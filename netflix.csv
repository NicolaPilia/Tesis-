35841;netflix;; Sep 20, 2018;Current  ;Anonymous Employee;How much does a functioning human cost?;;"I have been working for a year at Netflix.  I've seen what was supposed to be very mature people, sharing absolutely almost no contact that anyone would qualify as ""human"". Sure, that sounds hyperbolic, let me develop (and maybe cherry-pick a little).  Have you heard about our culture? The one about giving candid feedback? - I have seen people complaining of behavior they literally demonstrated themselves in the following days. But I have also seen these feedbacks resulting in tears both in the eyes of HR persons or fellow engineers. How human does that sound?  Have you heard about our culture? The one about not tolerating brilliant jerks? I have theless seen angriness and frustration, expressed in private, public and meeting. People rejecting new ideas by default, like, any ideas they wouldn't have worked themselves on for days wouldn't count. Even if those ideas are from the best examples in the industry or academics. How many publications/contributions have you seen from Netflix to computer science in general? How does it compare against any other company of that size in the Bay Area? Can you imagine either the real insecurity (x)or the lack of innovation that could lead to this situation?  Except for a few managers, directors or VPs feeling free enough to behave at work in the same way than how they live, almost every engineer I have been interacting with, have shared as little as possible about their private life. The rare exceptions of interpersonal exchange ends up around some sort of competitive behavior: Who is the most geeky, sportive, owns the fastest car/biggest house/visited the strangest place.  I've heard workaholic people complaining about ambitious peers who were over-managing, over-working to get even more work to do after. I feel like we're past workaholism at this point.  Maybe there are a lot of shy people! Maybe there is a culture of fear, not only of being fired, but also a fear of interacting with people going to be fired. Maybe it's all in my head, maybe people giving 5 stars to their experience here dont care the human aspect of a company. And maybe they're right.  What about your crush, your fears, your desires for the future, your appetite for life? I've been blessed to work in enough large companies to know that the behavior that I'm seeing in Netflix is not a healthy one. I've also been lucky enough to work in other industries more socializing than tech and I can tell that Netflix has a lot to do on that side, and off-sites or team meeting won't solve that problem.  I am afraid about the tragic, but inevitable consequences of the ways people operate in this company: I guess that the day the worst will happen, it will be addressed in an impersonal memo by Reed, followed-up by 1 or 2 reminders during offsites. Possibly commented by HR in a Q&A document. And move on. This company seems as reactive in its management of people as it is proactive in its business operations.  I still work at Netflix though, not only for the paycheck, but because I hope. I hope it will change. The needed change can't happen from a candid feedback, a Q&A, or only from inside. Change has to come from everyone, including people who take time to read comments like this one. Netflix has so many good people and offers such a great service.  As a curious Netflix employee reading this review: think about your past, isn't there a big human thing that you would love to feel again in your current company that you've felt in the past?  As a candidate: think about what would be a good question to ask to that HR partner once your package is almost here to be offered to you, think about that comment you make at the end of an interview when you're being asked by an engineer: ""Do you have any question for me?"" What Netflix needs is an inception, something that anyone and everyone would think about after leaving the call or the room they were sharing with you. Ask yourself, and then the others, the question you should ask if you think you want to spend a good amount of your life and energy in the place you're applying for.  - Will I learn and contribute to the knowledge of other's? Even outside the company? - Will I see emotional responses from my peers? Will that be for other reasons than being fired or bluntly criticized? - Will I find a friendly environment that will nurture my appetite for life? - What is the amount of emotional interaction (celebrating, sharing, playing) to expect from a company whose service is the best to ""entertain""? - Do androids dream of electric sheep?";Ask yourself those questions;3;2;1;5;5;4;52

35846;netflix;Los Angeles, CA; Oct 29, 2018;Current  ;Anonymous Employee;Great company, with some growing pains;When they say that Netflix chooses stunning colleagues, they are not kidding: I am constantly impressed with the smart, thoughtful people I work with on a daily basis. I love the company's focus on Inclusion & Diversity (and, I honestly notice it often, by looking around the room and seeing faces like mine in every meeting), and I am continually impressed at how the company adheres to these principles. The transparency is usually great, and it's fun to be a part of an exciting, growing company. The salary is exceptional, and the benefits are also excellent (note: hourly employees get slightly less in terms of benefits, but it's still great).  There's a lot of freedom here to set your schedule and work around personal commitments if you need to (e.g. my kid has a doctor's appointment, I will be WFH, etc.), as well as to make decisions that benefit the company, your team, etc.  The culture deck is intimidating when you first read it, but I have found that it's pretty right on - there are some things that I think are not adhered to quite as often as it says, but overall, it's on point.;"Work life balance is a thing, but I do think a lot of it is how well you defend your boundaries - I work a couple of hours of OT a week, and I am generally ""on call"" in the sense that I will check my email after hours, but I am not expected to work at off hours - in fact, my manager specifically tells me to wait until I am back at work to complete things. I do think upper management works very long hours, and that can lead to burn-out. The flip side of this is that there is a lot of flexibility to take vacation/personal time, and people trust you if you need to take some time for doctor's appointments, stuff for your kids, WFH, etc.  The firing culture doesn't seem to touch ICs as much as it does management. It is scary sometimes to see those messages come through, but the leaders do try to set context and make themselves available for comments, questions, concerns, etc.  I do think the whole concept of good ideas coming from anywhere is true to some extent, but it definitely depends on the team and the leader to whom you are pitching things. You have to be smart about choosing the right time/people.  The onboarding/training needs a lot of work. Not having a solid training for new hires was stressful and alienating. I spent the first few months wondering if I had made the right choice by coming here, but I am a year in, and feeling much more comfortable. They say it takes about 3 months to feel like you are not drowning, and 6 months to feel like you understand everything - that feels pretty accurate to me.";Bolster your training for new managers (especially when they are hired from outside the company).;4;4;5;4;5;4;8

Your good judgement is only good if you follow their opinion of good judgement. Even if you have a good reason to do something differently, its not okay.  Their policy of fail well means you can make a mistake once. not twice. Terminations are frequent, and abrupt. In the last 6-8 months they have termed 3 supervisors, and about 15-18 people. There is a higher than average rate of churn here.  While they pay high wages, and provide low cost benefits this is done as a way to make everyone replaceable. It makes it easy to attract new employees.

You can be exceeding expectations on both and still be fired for ""not providing an amazing customer experience"" which could be as simple as your supervisor doesn't think your tone of voice is positive enough. Your supervisor can and will sometimes listen to every call you took in a day to find something you did wrong to fire you over. You will never see anything in writing on any monitor including the one that gets you fired.";You pride yourself as a company on clarity.

The tech is your standard microservices architecture, and everything gets open-sourced, with a blog post and a nice conference talk. Eventually these projects wither because no one maintains them, and sometimes they dont even solve very effectively the problems they tout, but it's good PR for the engineers and 'leaders'.  Culture of fear is real. My manager was toxic, he loved to talk about diversity even though he was the biggest mansplainer in the room. My interview was interesting, it was a monologue of his rather unique theories of engineering management, most of which was a bunch of gibberish culled from the culture deck. When I got there I found him to be a pretty ineffective manager. He didn't have any engineering vision, no idea of strategy, and wasn't technical. If you get into an interview room and the manager spends 45 mins talking about himself, that's probably a sign to run!  Pick and choose what team you join. You can have either a pretty cool time with some smart folks, or have to deal with narcissists who believe their own PR.

They either like you or they donÉ??t. You HAVE to play work politics and meet as many upper level managers as possible. Your numbers, your adaption to their É??cultureÉ?ù, and your prior work experience DO NOT matter when it comes to growth within the company. 2. You canÉ??t get up and use the bathroom. Your breaks and lunches can be moved around (if approved by WFM) so they tell you to move your break up so you can get up and use the bathroom. You literally have to fill out HR accommodation forms to have certain privileges such as bathroom use. 3. You had an emergency? If you have the emergency hours to cover it, GREAT! But if you donÉ??t, expect to be put on probation or fired the next time you walk in. They expect you to PTO 24 hours before and itÉ??s like they wanted you to anticipate the emergency 24 hours before. 4. Coaching is a joke. Literally the sups ask us what WE want to work on. What we thought of our own performance and place those ideas into our action plan. My question is, arenÉ??t the sups suppose to know the problems? ArenÉ??t they suppose to be the ones prepared for the meeting and have a course of action? It feels like IÉ??m doing their job and they just say É??great idea let me write this down and submit it!É?ù They will ALWAYS tell you what you are doing wrong but unless upper management makes a comment about moral being down, they will never compliment you. 5. Utah is a right to work state. In plain English it means the company doesnÉ??t need to have a reason to fire you, hence why a lot of other big companies place their call centers here. This law allows some employers to abuse the stability of employees and base their decisions on emotions instead performance.;You want us to live by NetflixCS values yet your own supervisors donÉ??t live up to those values. Stop making it seem like itÉ??s ok to voice our opinion when in reality you fire people for crossing that line or for exposing upper management. You do not provide a stable working environment, nobody leads by example, stop promoting people that are ill equipped for the promotion and most of all stop treating us like customers by POS POS (keeping things positive and avoiding the problem to focus on what CAN be done) and dancing around our questions or concerns.;3;3;4;1;4;2;26

At most, itÉ??s applied to some ICÉ??s, but doesnÉ??t apply to management.É?˘ É?˘ There's a lot of politics between teams and orgs when there are overlapping projects and services. And having∂ˇoverlapping projects on different teams happens often. Negative and deceptive politics exists between teams in different orgs. ItÉ??s more rare, but it appears to be accepted and ignored.É?˘ É?˘ ThereÉ??s a large amount of internal team politics, as each engineer needs to make himself look better (and others worse) to keep their job, to get to the next pay level, to become a manager, etc. This will get worse as the company grows in size. Management is purposefully oblivious to all of this.É?˘ É?˘ HR is a weak org. Their main job is recruiting. They do very little to make the company culture adhere to the culture doc.É?˘ É?˘ Management is self-centered and arrogant. They wonÉ??t acknowledge real problems until it smacks them in the face. This creates the appearance of a kool-aid environment. Most employees will ignore the issues to get along and reduce friction. The environment will worsen over time.É?˘ É?˘ Management does not help with career growth.É?˘ É?˘ No official IC titles other than Senior Software Engineer. This practice is likely followed to reduce turnover so people dont realize that theyÉ??re not paid enough money or promoted high enough, as compared to others there. They are deciding your pay based on external info, so theyÉ??re probably privately assigning a title to you, anyway.

Its also really great to have an amazing brand on your resume.;"You will probably not ever have much development in the SLC CS site.

They are an accurate cross-section of experiences that show the reality of working at Netflix and how entirely it depends on your manager, or who gets fired or promoted and suddenly becomes your manager. You will have zero life outside of work, and even if you are someone who could never imagine being considered anything other than a top performer, let alone getting fired, recognize that you--yes, you--will very likely be let go abruptly within your first year--sometimes in a matter of weeks--with no opportunity to improve, at the sole discretion of your manager, who him/herself may or may not be competent or honest. Be sure that you can afford to live in whichever very expensive city you are relocating to with no income, and are willing to explain a firing in your next job search. Political backstabbing is the order of the day. The meeting culture is horrendous and symptomatic of an organization that is growing too rapidly and clutching desperately to a culture that doesn't scale. Ask anyone who has been at Netflix in a leadership or cross-functional position and they will tell you that they spend their entire day in meetings, and then spend all of their nights and weekends at home trying to actually get work done. And finally, if you do survive beyond the first year, dont expect pay progression. They will happily offer you more than whatever you are getting in your current position to bring you in, and then leave your pay stagnant for years if you were already ""over market.""";Recruiting away top talent and churning through them with no regard for them as human beings may have been a viable strategy when Netflix was a smaller company, but understand that many of the industries you need to recruit from are small and nearly tapped.

I always say the health of the company starts at the top and Reed Hastings is someone I highly respect as he can see through people's BS and keeps those around him honest. He's the kind of person that will give you personal and professional advice even at an all hands with hundreds of people in attendance. The work will feel like you're being 'thrown to the fire' due to the culture of high performance and no subscribed process, but if you know what you're doing and stay dedicated to your team's goals in a productive manner, you should be fine.;"While there are incredibly bright and talented designers at Netflix, I learned through my time there that this company was an engineering-first company. I mean, look at how long it took them to change the logo and get some design standards going. Design often times felt like a luxury than a necessity and there was a bit too much dependency on A/B testing to make decisions. I swear, I heard ""have we A/B tested this yet?"" in my dreams. A few times, I would point out that the results of the A/B test resulted in bad design solutions. It just seemed like upper management didn't understand design. As long as people are watching content and streaming patterns are on the up, then dont rock the boat. Also, watch out for those who play politics, sometimes the drama that plays out on projects or team dynamics is just unreal and some people just want to be the hero and get Reed Hasting's blessing. Unfortunately, there are some ""brilliant jerks"" in the company, learn to work around them and get stuff done right! Lastly, if you want a more life/work balance, this is probably not the place for you.

35994;netflix;Clearwater, FL; May 9, 2017;Former  ;Csr1;CSR I;Experience , Training , and Freedom of expression;Leadership , Punishments (and lack there of) favoritism;"I was contracted for netflix as a CSR . During my time there , I worked as hard as I could because I genuinely loved my job and where I worked . This specific location in clearwater is nice because they do give you a lot to do while on the phone and during idle time . There's foosball , a ping pong table , and a "" NRD lab"" where they have probably 8 tvs on the wall where they play different netflix tv shows and movies ( Supposed to be SFW but sometimes , especially very late at night we could watch whatever we wanted) There were also multiple tv's across the floor in about half of the pods and sometimes they would put on sports games and things to keep us happy . If you take all of that into consideration it sounds pretty great. All in all , I think most people there genuinely want to get the job done as quickly and efficiently as possible . The biggest issue they have is the people who are put into management . Even before I was there , there had been a line of people who all had been promoted purely because they were close with the right people . When it came to promotions ( To either CSR II or TL ) there was no rhyme or reason really what so ever. When you were put up for a promotion , they would tell you that it was going to be based off of stats, attendance, and professionalism . That is not usually what ended up happening . In my experience there the person that had some personal tie to either a specific TL or OM would always be the one to get the promotion . It was this way for absences as well . The attendance policy is on a rolling 60 day timeframe . That means , you may not have more than 4 ""Occurrences"" in 60 days or you would come up for review . When occurrences were actually given was definitely not regulated. The way around this is just basically to take 3 days off in a row if you're going to call off . People would apply for a weekend off and never be able to get it because they didn't allow very many requests those days . So the solution that they came up with is that if you were close to a TL , you could get them to put you on a MLOA or a PLOA . Better yet , be friends with an OM and you can literally just call them like your personal attendance line and get VTO (Voluntary time off) . Favorites WERE played. Now , there are some GREAT people there. I met some really really great friends there . But the problem is that they don't have a great way of dealing with anything . If something went down , there was no uniform way of dealing with it . When controversial topics would come out we were basically told not to say anything conflicting or anything that could get us or them into trouble. But when it comes to people calling screaming at you about a show called ""Dear White People"" calling you racist and asking RIDICULOUS questions , the ""No comment"" thing doesn't really work . Your performance is based off of handle time, Re contact rate , and your survey answers mostly . The Highest you are allowed for dissatisfaction is 4% I believe (It may have changed now I'm not sure ) That means you are counting on someone being merciful on their bad day , and that the kid who called you through the app who you HAVE TO send to survey doesn't hit you as well . The last thing I will say , is that the scheduling is based off of performance and attendance . Not like that is a huge issue , but the problem is that there are not very many earlier schedules . I would say there is probably 7 teams on the floor from 6 AM until 1-3PM and even then they are sending people home left and right most mornings . After 3 there is a lot of calls and you usually will be on the phones non stop until around 10 or 11 when it slows down. There are over night schedules, but you have to START working after 8PM to get the extra dollar and they cut the overnight teams down to 1 or 2 when I was there . This means that if you don't get almost perfect stats , you may be given a bad rank during the quarterly shift bids , and get stuck with a schedule that you can't work or just simply don't want . Maybe one or two schedules have weekends off and those obviously get taken first . I will let you take from this what you will . It is a great way to get your foot in the door . The company I am with now JUMPED at the chance to hire me because of the experience I gained here. Not only will it help you professionally , I gained a lot of technical experience and now am looking toward a career in IT . Just don't allow yourself to get swallowed up in the machine and you can definitely be successful .";3;1;2;4;2;;5

You'll be working with mostly extremely competent people. Dealing with teams within the company is extremely easy, as most people are very helpful and efficient. They pay you a lot of money, and give you perks like free food, paid cell phone bill, 401k, etc. This is all great, but for me, the biggest draw is always people, and your team will make or break your experience here, so make sure you know what you are getting into at the interview, and dont accept jobs with teams that you dont feel excited about being part of.;"The high salary leads some people to ramp up their lifestyles, they then become dependent on being here. This in turn creates a culture of fear where people are constantly stressing out that they are ""not doing enough"" and might be fired any minute. This also extends to the directors of teams, and when your management is stressed, it will always trickle down to create a lousy experience for you. This makes for an extremely toxic environment at times where teams are often working on similar projects, thus competing against each other to stay relevant, which is just utter idiocy. The high pay ensures that there is way more politicking than would be needed or appropriate in such situations. This in turn can have a very demoralizing effect on the peons doing the actual work, who often feel compelled to work on nights, weekends and public holidays for goals that are often vague, and projects that are often shelved. The most insidious effect of this is observed when people contemplate taking PTO, when many employees have told me that they weren't able to relax or take as much time off as they needed, as they were constantly wondering what would happen to their jobs, and whether or not they were doing enough to ""deserve"" time off. If you've never felt this, it's a rotten state of mind, and you will feel it quite a bit here. Many times, I've felt the need to quit the field altogether, but the money and my team makes me stay for now, so I'll likely stay till my team changes.  Moral of the story here is: You'll get paid a lot. You'll also likely be laid off sooner than you expect. You'll also likely make a LOT less at your next place. Adjust for your standard of living appropriately so you can keep your head above the circus fray, and dont get used to the good things.";More communication with your teams is absolutely essential if you want to retain good people, but you don't need a Glassdoor review to tell you that. Empower your HR teams to instill the idea that taking time off is a healthy part of working here, and no one should feel nervous about taking time off. You will need to say this many times before it becomes part of the culture.  Ensure that teams are not competing against each other, specifically in the Engineering department. We are not here to throw each other off our respective ladders, but to learn, and to help the company grow as a result of what we learn here. Cross-collaboration between teams should be of the utmost priority, not working at cross-purposes as is the case with many teams now.  For the most part, this is a good place to be. Make it better, and make more of an effort at every level to keep the organization flat. We already have job insecurity, we do not need hierarchy to make it worse.;3;2;3;5;5;3;130

Has health insurance so that's something.;The work is monotonous and draining. The chat team was dissolved, and then they shifted my hours to meet 'business needs' which took away the last bit of faith I had that they care about the employee. Supposedly you can choose from set shifts, but the time you pick is randomly assigned, meaning if you're randomly assigned to pick last, then there are no good options left. Could also mean that you work there for 2.5 years like my coworker and never get to have a weekend day off. In training they told us over and over again that top performers were promoted within 3 to 6 months but there have literally been no opportunities. They said numbers didn't matter, they promised unlimited time off, and a whole host of other perks. That has all been blatantly false, the entire job is a numbers game, you sit glued to your desk waiting for a coaching or meeting to break up the nightmare of the day but those keep getting pushed off to the future, which never happens. Unlimited time off was taken away, and you could be fired for a whole host of silly reasons, I myself have seen multiple coworkers walked off the floor for minor infractions, and the new policy of only 3 tardies (which could be 1 minute late) per YEAR is punitive. Even the free drinks are slowly being taken away, we have stupid lemon water options now or espresso, which I can't drink. This job has given me anxiety, I am actively looking for a different job and will quit the moment I'm able.;Don't lie to your employees, hire enough people so that you're not glued to the phone with back to back calls all day, promote an option of breaking up the work day instead of sitting stuck in the cubicle. You can't even take personal time for crying out loud, you get in trouble for needing to take a 2 minute bathroom break outside your schedued break time. Ive never had a job that so horrendously micromanages time to be sure you're getting every last second of work from the employee. Actually be truthful about advancement opportunities. I was told CRS2 would be avaliable August of 2016, that got pushed to January of 2017, then March of 2017, and now maybe 6 months into the future.

Still have emails of praise from Senior ops from Netflix Om's and led a 22 person team 3 months and it was 2nd overall in stats. It was because I cast the large shadow of a leader who could move mountains with my coaching, feedback and motivation. I came to you before FMLA, you approved my leave but let me go. Unheard of in any business. Ask my time off was approved and I was protected federally in my time off. It is the job of the company to get support to team while I was out. I still never had that leadership training to teach me not to Change coaching log (said same thing in log of what csr needed to do) without the csr present. CSR didn't even notice change, it was grammar and verbiage update of the same coaching recommendation. Remember giving me lower bowl Jazz tickets 2x for performance? Performance still high when using Federal Medical Leave Act insurance and still let go. Reading all the reviews left here are a clear direction of poor structure, internal training and bottom to top processes that produce consistency and values. Changing values, policy's monthly create chaos. Convergys has higher employee satisfaction and where I work now is best in state company to work for 2 years in row - Thumbtack!

New technologies.;"Experience in Netflix totally depends on the supervisor. If you are lucky and get a matured manager, there is no reason to not like working in NETFLIX. However it could be a nightmare if your manager does not like you for some reason. It is always your words vs manager's word in there (happened in my case and they believe the manager). I was hired under a manager who convinced me to join Netflix (I had 24 emails from that person persuading me). However I learned after joining that I am supposed to report to a new manager and the very first day that new guy complained that I have never worked with JAVA and AWS (Then why did he agree to take me in his team in the first place ? ). Nightmare started from that very day. He kept on mentioning the same thing every one on one. He forced me to move my position in every meeting and make sure I seat where he points me to. He will talk to all my co-workers and inform them if he is cancelling one on ones, for me he wont do anything and just disappear. He will constantly irritate me saying how good he was when he joined. He will always shout at me and try to ignore my opinions on any damn technical stuff. I was totally terrified of him and knew that he will make sure that I fail. He tried all he could. He gave me two projects and one project scope kept changing and changing. Still i tried to keep up and developed good relationships with other team managers, members and project managers.One day (I am sure my manager was waiting for that day) I wrote something incorrect in an email (this is my 4th month I guess). He pounded on me, and also after a 14 hour continuous on call, I took a 2 min break, he shouted at me for 15 minutes for missing a false alram ! I apologized. He tried to blame me for what I did not do and said he and someone else was watching me silently, while I was chatting with someone else about some technical issue over a group chat. So unethical ! He said some PM complained about me and when I asked for the names and examples he refused. I raised the alarm to higher management and they said it is ""his word vs mine"". One day they said they are sorry I had to go through this and next day they change the tone and said they have to believe my manager. I requested them to talk to engineers and get feedback. They refused to even do that. I resigned the next week as I could not take the humiliation and realized that if I stay back and work in the same group, they will find some excuse to fire me. I knew all companies where I worked before were waiting to take me back any day. So I had no worry. The funny part is the people who were working with me kept on sending me emails about how good it was to work with me and they were surprised that I left. But my manager never found anything good in me.  I wish I had a better manager in NETFLIX, then I would enjoy my life there so much. Please make sure you understand your supervisor before you join. That is the most important thing. Everything else will fall into place.";Give engineers some more respect and try to understand who is at fault. Look at that persons history before you conclude in 4 months or 5th months just based on one person, the manager who was not happy with the hire from very very first day.;1;3;1;5;5;1;13

There constantly breathing down your neck and watching you looking for you to do something wrong. THeres little warning. Generally you get one. If your lucky or buddy buddy with with management or the supes you might get a bit more slack, maybe a lot more. If they dont like what they see they could be rid of you in less than a month and they openly joke about terminating people and about how expendable you are from day one. I read the reviews on here and went in and smellled the fish immediately. FIrst off they bring on a ton of people all the time for an amazing job so where do they end up. All of this is contingent on whether they decide if you are fit for production. You could be let go at the end of training and they dont give you any metrics on how that decision is made.;Remember that you are giving skilled people an amazing offer that leads many to leave stable employment.

Good pay, requires a fair amount of patience and people skills. Free m&m's and a drink dispensers, cool cafeteria for a call center.;"In my time of working for NetflixCS, I was stressed mentally and physically, they use losing your job against you in every single humanly mishap that could happen, emergency with the kids? Not excusable or ability to have excusal by reasonable cause, they literally tell you after the first time that your job will be on the line if you are so much as 5 minutes late again. Get something a little mixed up on the knowledge base? You're on thin ice. I feel as if I started feeling this way once they had moved me to a new team. This ""supervisor"" was bossy, not a leader. Raised her voice and talked to few on the team like children. They were smart and switched teams after a few occurrences of her demonstrating her work ethic. I decided, I can change my schedule soon I dont want to make a fuss, so I stayed next thing I know I'm one of the leaders on the team we had a coaching and all she did for the first time ever was acknowledge my hard work, I was proud. After all the fear of f'ing up and losing my job I realized I could relax. A week later I was fired because I had to miss 1 day because my 2 year old daughter had strep, mind you this, my sup was constantly late or leaving early for non emergency type situations, was constantly on her phone on the call floor, for non work related types of things such as looking through social media and online shopping, there is an example of blatant favoritism. I knew people who missed much more time than I had, and had never even been spoken too, or threatened. I would take this to hr but as my sup said when terming me, the decision is final and I will not longer be working at Netflix customer service.";You really need to review how your employees feel with their supervisors. If you want the ACE you have to be fair and flexible with your employees concerns. You lost a very good, and determined employee because of poor placement and no flexibility with attendance, considering there was never PTO available or sick days. Even others employees at the site did not understand why I was fired. That's something to think about. I know I'm not the only one from this specific team that feels the same way.;1;1;2;1;2;3;6

We had all the paperwork set up with them and had everything figured out, the paperwork was supposedly supposed to protect our jobs when we had to miss work because of that condition. Then one day they CALLED both of us, called, they waited for a day we weren't working and then called rather than bring us in in person which I thought was low, and then they fired us both on the same day saying that it was for attendance purposes and that they had given us warnings. Both my husband and I were shocked because we had been working with HR all this time and thought it had been taken care of and was going to be ok. We didn't get any warning whatsoever, every time we met with HR they would just say make sure to get the paperwork in, make sure you're here when you're supposed to or we might have to ""separate employment"", but we never got any formal warning, or anything to indicate, hey we're really close to firing you or anything like that.

Benefits dont really cover much, 2. HR coordinators are a freaking joke. I am on short term disability due to pregnancy complications. I was extremely active and fast about getting all the management I needed involved so there wasn't any I didn't knows down the line. My doctor has suggested my return date to be September 1st based on my exams. I've been very diligent in updating the HR coordinator over leaves about what's going on after each appointment, to which I rarely get a response. Then a few weeks after my last check up email that I sent to this HR Coordinator I get a response that's basically threatening my position as I'm not getting better fast enough, demanding I bring in proof of extention by the end of the week. I have no problem with providing documentation for them. I do have an issue with when I ask a HR Coordinator if they have a fax number that I could send this to as traveling is a bit difficult for me at the moment or when I ask about the process of maternity leave I get a three sentence email basically saying I dont know and text me if you have questions. Then when I email saying I'm unfortunately phoneless at the moment til I can get it repaired can I just email. I get no response at all! They say they care, they dont. They treat you like you're lying about everything. They are extremely pushy and have no communication together. I have no doubt she's trying to fire me as with every email she makes it harder for me to comply to her requests. They also refuse to work with scheduling and always have negative feedback. I am a great agent and found the calls to be easy, however due to their pushy you aren't like us or good enough ways I have feared for my job since the second week of training.

Most of the hard algorithmic problems have already been solved at Netflix. Most of the hard scaling problems have already been solved by Amazon-- and most engineers at Netflix write thin REST services. It's not rocket science. But the way folks discuss their work, you'd think we were working at Space X. Good thing engineering management is clueless and arrogant, and more interested in engineering by powerpoint than solving real problems. In general, there's a 'not invented here' syndrome which permeates groups, and so a lot of reinventing the wheel. The compensation is bloated, so people are trying to maximize their paychecks. It leads to poor behavior- personal branding is more important than solving problems and petty personal politics and territorial struggles are more important than collaboration. All in all, a great place to get a fat paycheck, but day to day, the work is uninspiring. If you want a real engineering driven culture, led by engineers I'd suggest going to Facebook or Google.;Get rid of the middle management bloat.

The culture deck you see on the job site is real. The management team expects you to be a stellar performer, but you CAN make mistakes in the name of learning. However, if you dont learn quickly from the mistake you made, you are in trouble.  You have a lot of freedom and responsibilities to help company move forward. Things also change so quickly that what you think is true last quarter may not be a month from now.

It helps to spend energy recruiting existing female tech leaders but also fostering women who already work here who have leadership potential. The second part I don't see happening - the women's groups here seem more focused on hiring new women and not as much on helping technical women grow their careers and leadership skills here.

Freedom and responsibility is definitely practiced here. No one will hand you a project, deadlines, and a specific way to go about doing your work. They trust that they've hired the best people to do the job and they leave it up to the individual to identify problems and figure out how to solve them. This sort of environment is not for everyone, because you have to build strong enough relationships with your coworkers so they'd go to bat for you on your projects. Team-building isn't a company-mandated activity here. It's an everyday practice and an integral part of the job.  Feedback is candid and immediate, so get ready. There's no sugarcoating here. To be successful here, you have to be open to criticism, no matter how direct. This, again, might not work for everyone, but it makes your next course of action very clear, as opposed to sugarcoated feedback that leaves you confused as to what you should do.;Netflix gets a bad rap, because it's not for everyone. The fact is, that's not necessarily a bad thing, and there's no shame in trying something out and seeing if it works out for you. What appears difficult about Netflix is exactly what makes it a great place to work. You have to be able to manage yourself, no one will manage your time for you.  While the company is not as diverse as it could be, the commitment to diversity is something I've witnessed first-hand from leadership and employees alike. The tone is set that diversifying the company is a part of everyone's job at Netflix, not just the recruiting team.  If you need someone to manage your time for you, need your tasks to be very clear and outlined by a manager, or you can't handle feedback, then Netflix isn't for you.;Continue fostering employee relationships, and emphasize the importance of making those connections as early as possible in an employee's journey.;4;4;5;5;5;4;11

While the center is still miles better than your average call center, there's been a big shift to being numbers and metric focused (something we were promised from day 1 of the center opening would not happen) often at the expense of employees and floor support. There's a major disconnect between HR/WFM and what actually happens on the floor, and often we are given no context as to why decisions negatively impacting us are made.  The center here in SLC has also stopped promoting people internally- a majority (if not all) of the supervisors in the last several months were hired externally. This is another example of changing values at Netflix, rather than giving current (well qualified) employees opportunity for growth, they hire people unfamiliar with the process and product, which further impacts the floor negatively.;Resume promoting internally rather than hiring externally.

The tooling is excellent, deployments globally are a breeze, and one can gather great insights from the metrics.  Pay and benefits are amazing.;"Please stop firing amazing talent. Other posts here paint the wrong picture -- that those who survive at Netflix are the best. It is inaccurate at best. The quality of many of those let go is not in doubt, but management is frequently inept at appreciating their ability. Many who stay are very bright, but many who are let go are as well.  If you do not tow engineering's backwards line you are looked down upon. People live in constant fear of being canned and this causes them to behave in an immature fashion painting their peers as less than they are. Some seem to delight in the plight of others who are let go -- a mentality of ""better him than me."" It is not survival of the fittest, it is a blind thought police, who speak openly about wanting to hear others' opinions (as long as the opinion agrees with theirs) and then balk when they are actually given. Alternatives are not actually wanted, obedience and maintaining the status quo are. If you are to be disruptive, you must be disruptive in their way. If that makes no sense it is because it is truly illogical.  One can hope this is not so pernicious as to infect every team and I would dare to say that it isn't. But do your homework and know what you are getting yourself into.";"Look inward to a policy and culture that perhaps on its surface appears attractive but hides an ugly story of fear and a need to conform which stifles creativity and achieving quality work. Quality need not be continually sacrificed in the name of ""getting sh** done.""  You were a once great company with great engineers. Stop it with the culture of fear. Just stop it. It does not encourage making the right decisions, people do things to protect their job and high salary, not because it is the best thing to do. It is poisoning the work and you are and can be better than that. Also do not fool yourselves with those who pay lip service to the culture in public -- in private, I have found, they lambast it. Perhaps a retrospective on your culture is in order.";2;3;2;2;5;2;32

You are challenged daily to become better at your job, and you're given the tools and the training to do exactly that! You're coached weekly and your leaders are great motivators and great people to interact with. It's like everyone gives a damn about their careers, and their own personal growth as well as YOUR career and personal growth!  Other Perks: Great wages, 401k, very affordable Health Insurance (after your temp agency contract is over and they convert you to full-time Netflix). The building I work in is pretty great. It's a fun and colorful atmosphere with a lot of 20-and-30-somethings working hard and having fun! Around every corner is some kind of Netflix branding that's related to one of their shows, like Orange Is The New Black, or House of Cards. There's a cafeteria that cooks fresh food for you during the day (Vegetarian options included!). And Netflix covers half the cost of the meals so you can get really great lunches on the cheap! Free coffee (there's even an espresso machine to make your own lattes - also free!). And there's occasionally Netflix swag given out, like windbreakers, water bottles, even Netflix labeled sweatpants! It's easily the best place I've ever worked!;If you dont give a damn about your career or your own development, you won't last long. The talent pool is also extremely saturated with highly skilled people, which makes it very challenging in terms of promotions.  Because it's a call-center, there can be a bit of turnover with the staff. This is pretty common for call centers in my experience, and terminations always seem to happen for the same reason: Attendance  If you get terminated for attendance, it's because you were prone to missing work frequently. They will also let you go if you're a tool to your customers on the phone calls you take. A good rule is dont swear at, or start freaking out at them. Follow this and you should be fine. You're graded on your Customer Satisfaction levels and how active you are at putting in the practice to get better. If you're not getting better at your job, or you're not working on the areas where you need improvement, you'll get let go. But your Supervisors are pretty good at telling you exactly what needs work, and they work with you to get to where you need to be. And if you're in any danger of getting terminated, either due to your performance or your attendance, your Supervisors are pretty upfront about it, giving you plenty of fair warning as well as an opportunity to turn it around. Generally speaking, if you get fired from this place, it's because you either didn't care, or you didn't show up.;I'd like to see more healthy food options, especially in the Avanti Markets.

36129;netflix;; Aug 17, 2015;Former  ;Anonymous Employee;Best place I've ever worked;"""Freedom and Responsibility"" rings mostly true, although you'd have to be stupid to not realize it isn't 100% true always and in everything. Simple, indisputable example: you can't decide how much you make, yourself. That's an obvious statement, yet it proves there definitely are no-goes and as such, gray areas. In practice, it hasn't been an issue for me--just clarifying. You want X number of monitors, Y super-amazing-computer, come in at 11am, leave at 4pm, take numerous vacations, ask (and receive a real answer!) dang near anything about what movies/shows they're secretly bidding on in Hollywood, etc, etc. Not only things a reasonable person would want to do/have, more like a well spoiled person. This all assumes you are communicating this with your team and performing well above average--Netflix does *not* knowingly hire junior, mid-level, or wannabe-senior engineers. I haven't personally seen a bunch of people get fired, but of the one or two I've seen, it was not surprising. I have noticed some teams are more critical of performance than others.  Like any company of a decent size, not every team has exactly the same culture. Mine was absolutely wonderful day-to-day. My managers help you and coordinate, more than ""manage"" me, which is huge just by itself. To this point, most engineering managers I know of aren't really programmers, which I think is a huge bonus because there is far less risk of them wanting to micromanage projects and implementation details. That said, they are ALL very very technical and can fairly trivially smell BS.  Salary: you'll be more than happy as far as I've heard from co-workers. For me, they made it impossible for me to ever even consider leaving because of salary. Almost every place I've worked prior, I had at some point felt underpaid. Not here, I felt very much appreciated and paid as such.  Summary: YMMV, like in every big company, but seriously that's super important to understand, but my experience was amazing and by far the best place I've ever worked, all things considered. I left for personal reasons that aren't related to Netflix--wife/family stuff.";If you're not a high performer, but you manage to sneak in, the fear of being canned could certainly be real since YOU WILL inevitably be discovered. But dont second guess yourself. It should be obvious whether or not you are a high performer.  Sometimes discussions on the Freedom and Responsibility culture turns sort of cult-like. With a select number of people, questioning its real-world implications has been met with very clear disgust, almost denial. Very rare, though. For me was trivial to brush off.;"Do: continue soliciting feedback both positive and negative/constructive. Do continue to hire top-tier talent only. Do continue tweaking the culture.  Don't: continue having 360s, some how foster year-long feedback instead. Don't use terms or policies defined as ""unlimited"", which is in practice about as ""unlimited"" as AT&T's data plans were in 2011. It makes almost every coworker I talked to uncertain about what it means in practice and of course made things vary among teams.";5;5;5;4;5;4;17

I'm never dreading going to work, the supervisors, agents and even operations management all talk to each other on a human level and no one is snarly or stuck up. Its an extremely chill environment with high expectations. You are expected to do your job and be an adult, and everything else is extremely relaxed. If you think you can come to work and mess around, you're not going to have a job long, but I've been here almost a year now and everything is just as amazing now as when it first opened.;I wouldn't say there are loads of downsides, we are a 24 hour call center so when you are hired you are told you need to be flexible with your work schedule. Most schedules you'll have for a good 3-4 months but when new schedules come out you need to be willing to take it on. We were told this at least ten times before being hired, so you can't really complain. And even if you get a schedule you dont want you can trade and they won't stop you.;I would just say to keep doing what you're doing. K really appreciate how much you seem to care about your employees.;5;5;5;5;5;5;5

The pressure, the anxiety, the fear. They have been massively hiring and now they are firing, for no reason. Well, from what I have seen it's either because they thought they needed you but they really dont, or because you are about to become too expensive after roughly 2-4 months with health insurance etc..The bottom line is you are not treated like a grown up but just as a tool and management is completely useless.;Don't hire someone unless you really need him/her.

There is no such thing as ""high performance"". The company just uses and abuses, hire and fire, really talented people found by a random staffing agency that will promise you 6 months+. Netflix prefers to hire full time ""likable"" people only, not skilled people. Upper management simply micro manages every little baby step you are allowed to take, yet full time peers will bash you and take you down until you are fired. The company will not fire people that have been working there for a while even though they cannot keep up with the company growth.

They have a lot of games and videos, as well as devices to occupy your free time. It is extremely DIFFICULT to get fired. Which means that if you do get fired then you SERIOUSLY and imaginably screwed up.;"Your base PAY as of 2014-2015, as you are contracted out and paid by 24/7 is at the most 12.00 an HOUR! I do not know how Glassdoor came up with $15.  You are verbally abused everyday by the customer. The technology and the Knowledge base can chance on you, so you need to be extremely adaptable.  If someone starts calling you names, you can not hang up and you can not make outbound calls.  You are held to metrics and those standards are extremely difficult to maintain unless you have been working in a call center for 5 years. If you do not perform you will be written up.  One of those metrics is your call back rate, handle time (less than 5 and 1/2 minutes) and DSAT's (less than 4%) which translates into 1 NO in the survey.  Attendance is non-negotiable. I was sick for 9 weeks (I had my voice for less than 25% of the time) and I even brought in a doctors note explaining my situation and I STILL got written up.  They have shift bids, which means that every 6 months you can bid for a new shift. If your metrics are mediocre or bad, then you will be moved to what every shift they give you. Most places try to put you in shift according to your requests and needs. This is not that place. You can bison your own shift...and possibly keep it. My call center lost half of their work force due to the previous shift bid. They said they were going to try and change it to make it more ""fair"", but when I left, they can completely removed my shift time.  They did NOT tell me about shift bids when they hired me.  If you try for CSR 2 and dont meet the standard by day 90, you will lose your job. You do not go back to CSR 1 or given another chance.  iF YOU want to TRADE, then the person you trade with has to be approved by your team lead and theirs...and vise versa.

36201;netflix;Los Gatos, CA; Nov 18, 2014;Current  ;Senior Program Manager;An incredible environment that will definitely make you grow as a professional;I have worked for Netflix for 3 years. As most of reviews say, it is incredible to see how open and honest the culture is. The company is still pretty flat for its size, and you can feel your impact on initiatives you work on. Development moves very fast and our cycles are short and iterative. Multiple 6-month long projects in other companies get out the door in a matter of a few weeks.  I definitely feel like reviews on Glassdoor do not make justice to the Netflix environment. Yes, there is a lot of work, but I do not feel people get let go all the time, or that anyone would feel scared of being fired without reason. People do not get let go without fair warning. Everyone I know that has been let go so far saw it coming and recognizes it is the best for both them and the company. I find it hard to believe sometimes we have to overcome people's fears in that aspect. And newcomers realize very fast there is a myth and feel great to have joined.  In short, it is a remarkable, fair and candid company and I am thrilled to have joined and I plan to go nowhere in the next 5 years.;I agree there is no career plan or defined development, but then again, this translates into a lot of freedom to forge your own path. Plus, people who are hired are usually senior, so I feel there is less of a need for a strict career plan. When you work at Netflix, you are exposed to so much that it is easy to explain why you grow so much in a short period of time.;One of the biggest fears within the company is that our amazing culture gets diluted as we grow, so it is important to continue investing to keep the culture alive.;5;4;5;4;5;4;21

36208;netflix;Los Gatos, CA; Nov 24, 2014;Current  ;Senior Software Engineer;Well treated, enjoyable environment.;* Culture deck is very close to accurate. From my experience, few things have differed from the information available publicly. I was concerned that there would be a 'culture of fear' before I joined but it has not been so. * Exceptional senior management. They keep the company on course, share information freely, are incredibly knowledgable, and open to answering any employee questions. I have never been more impressed with a senior management team. * Comp and benefits are outstanding. I started about a year ago and since then the company has increased my salary by over 50%. Having had recent, competitive offers, it is truly top-of-market pay. * Good work-life balance and unlimited time off.;* No formalized training or advancement. If you want to try out different teams or roles this isn't the place. * No long-term career objectives. Nearly every single engineer has the same title so there are no career goals to work towards. This also means no promotions (unless you're in management). * All engineering positions are based out of Los Gatos. If you live elsewhere in the Bay, commuting is a requirement.;Great place to work overall.

36209;netflix;Los Gatos, CA; Nov 17, 2014;Current  ;Senior Software Engineer;A roller coaster ride of excitement and stress;Excellent salary, smart people, great time flexibility, satisfying projects. The company values of freedom and responsibility are really like treating employees like adults and trusting them to execute the best overall decisions for the company, which is effective when enough context is given. Innovation and experimentation is rewarded well and many opportunities for ongoing education are offered.;Internal politics. Lots of blame game behavior played as subtly (yet transparently if you pay attention) as possible. Some managers spend too much time in the code instead of managing their team. I had the experience of offering many recommendations for improving team performance and not having them implemented because the culture here is to just do what you want and either get rewarded hugely or sacked. Management coaching appears to be improving, but inconsistently applied. I've seen people who need to be let go stay on for a long time with many opportunities to change and people who were very competent let go without much warning that they need to change something. I've also seen projects executed that solved the business problems presented but were dropped because management didn't like it rather than some other specific reasons.;Management is not about process, I think Netflix has that correct. Excellent management is about getting problems out of the way of employees so that they can excel and about managing interpersonal conflicts so that a team can leverage one another's strengths to push the team higher than before. I think this element is missing on some teams at Netflix and that there is too much emphasis on daily high performance (important) and little building of loyalty or camaraderie.;4;4;4;3;5;4;18
36210;netflix;Los Gatos, CA; Dec 11, 2014;Current  ;Senior Engineering Manager;At Netflix the technology is the WHAT you do, providing great content for subscribers to enjoy is the WHY;"Netflix is singularly focused. They want to provide great family content for their subscribers to enjoy. By doing that, people feel they are getting the most from their monthly subscription. They have a robust service that is well architected, and they have discipline that has been honed for over a decade to become the best at what they do. As so many leadership books say, you can tell way more about someone by what they say NO to, and how well they can say NO. Netflix doesn't do ads, pay-per-view, purchasable content, or porn. Just thoughtful, edgy, and family programming so you can enjoy your subscription. They're bigger than people perceive, around 3,000 at time of this writing, but still have that startup feel of ""just get stuff done."" They get rid of all unnecessary process, so even in management, I can spend most of my time focusing on adding value to our customers instead of administrivia.";Netflix prides themselves on hiring super senior people that are like a pro team. Everyone is treated like a professional. You won't find any interns at Netflix. You'll only be working with people that have been in the industry and are smart at what they're doing--but that doesn't mean they're smart at everything. So some coordination and challenging of each other is necessary for success. If you're more introverted and dont speak up much, and not much of a self-starter, this isn't a good company for you.;The singular focus is fantastic, but a little bit of effort toward leadership development would help the company through the next growth spurt it needs and assure we can grow our next level of executive leaders from within.;4;4;4;4;4;4;9

Anything from people not remembering their password to the website to death threats. You had just 4 minutes to try to make them happy somehow and get them off the line before you got an instant message asking what the problem was. If you had to many ""No's"" you get fired on the spot. Call time too long? Fired. People came and went so much I didn't want to get to know them well because I knew they'd be out the door shortly. I had an incredible team coach that had a lot of faith in me which allowed me to persist in this enviorment. When the whole ""separate dvd shipping and online streaming"" failed they fired him and many, many others. I hung around for 9 months before I quit, the pressure to make metrics was savage and it was estimated that only 5% of the employee's would make it to a full year. I could go on with situations where the customer was extremely abusive, said no to the survey and went way way over the 4 minutes I was allowed only to have my job threatened for not meeting metrics but hopefully you get the idea.";My advice to management?

I am a highly educated, sharp, always employed individual and I found it very challenging to work for Netflix long-term. I've been employed in restaurant management, accounting and retail (just to name a few) and this company was by far, the worst place I've ever worked. At my youngest, I was a Merry Maid and I even found that much more enjoyable then slaving away to constant surveys, unintelligent callers and unrealistic expectations. Forget about taking vacation- embrace ocassional, mandatory over-time. Expect callers to personally threaten you and your family.

You can advance quickly within the hub. They have wonderful tech support!! They promote great culture and great values within the hub. Most hubs have really great solid group of hourly employees, and management can have vacation pretty much whenever. Company poured gifts on the management at the annual meetings to show their appreciation! They have a really great HR team!;It was really tough to manage work life and home life, due to the crazy hours. You are there until the job is done for the day, so you never have an out time! Upper management beyond the hubs gets a little dicey! Upper management is full of people who only got hired because they knew the right people not because of their talent or embodiment of the company values, and because of that really poor decisions are made when it comes to hiring managers to run the hub operations and when to fire hub managers as well, but HR is there to keep most things in check, The annual management meetings are a giant frat party with an excess of drinking and the only way to get in with the upper management is to rub shoulders with them and drink alongside of them! It also was hard to respect your regionals in the morning after talking with them as they slur their words into a puddle of drool and can't even stand up by 930pm! ? Only other downside was they did pry into your personal life far too often? They wanna tell you who you can hang out with and dont want you fraternizing with anyone outside of work.;;5;1;5;5;5;3;4

It asks are you satsified with your netflix experience. So, there was a lot of frustration where they had a lot of people listen to you and  of them could really tell you what you could have done better in that call to make the person say yes to the survey. So, they give you tips like start every call differently instead of opening the call the same way or saying the customer's name over and over to help them feel like they have a connection with you to say yes.";Stop focusing so much on if some one says no to the survey if you're not going to specifically ask if the representative helped the customer.

Also it depends on which team you are part of. My general observation is, larger the team greater the politics being played within. * IT IS LITERALLY TRUE THAT IT IS CULTURE OF FEAR, no matter how talented you are. I have seen ppl being walked out they were far more talented than other mediocre engineers surviving there for 3-4 years just because they lick the managers a*s and I have seen managers loving it being licked :) * Few managers who came from Google or some other similar companies, think that they know everything in the world and act as if they rule the world but actually they are literally dumb a*s when it comes to real work. * They claim it is all rockstar engineers and the fire who are not but I have seen ppl surviving for ages not even knowing what they did for all these years at Netflix and they are pure mediocre engineers. * My advice to engineers would be if you are happy with the work what you are doing right now or with other offers in hand, dont fall for the salary trap, it is merely an illusion.;* Gets rid of all mediocre managers, directors and those stupid engineers. * Change the culture of fear from its root because that creates so much politics inside.

There is a level of 'playing the game' but not to an extent that I'd say is greater than anywhere else.

For some reason going into this I did not think it would be a typical customer service experience based on my own satisfaction with Netflix for the past 3 years. It's pretty easy work, but so many people who called were lazy and/or arrogant jerks. Some of them made me feel like I was an inch tall. It was emotionally draining, especially for someone as sensitive as I am. The pressure to meet the 0% DSAT also didn't help. The survey asks about the company but it's answer is a reflection of the customer service and high DSATs effect job performance. We're expected to convey a relaxed, friendly attitude and build a personal rapport with the customer, but with pressure of the DSAT it's hard not to make everything sound forced and phony because you want to really turn it on to try get a yes out of the person. I'm an introvert so faking conversations and trying to think of chit-chat was hard for me. Do not take this job if you're sensitive and dont have strong conversational skills.

36358;netflix;Hillsboro, OR; Apr 10, 2012;Former  ;CSR-1;The cracks start to show pretty quickly.;Well-paying for a call center, free fruit, cheap soda, a nice building, free Netflix.;Your work experience almost depends entirely on your manager, and your manager may or may not change every month. Things that one manager may not care about (and tell you not to worry about) will be brought up against you six months later as a final warning. Sometimes policies are suggestions and other times they are concrete, and this will change at random and get you terminated. This isn't just on the ground floor either, one day everything's fine and the next ten managers are let go and their teams dispersed amongst the remaining set (but everything's still fine guys, dont worry). There is almost zero room for advancement, managers are hired in from the outside and the best anyone hired at entry-level can expect is to become a CSR-2, a position that doesn't actually pay more. Anyone and everyone competent seemed to slowly leave for better jobs in my time there, and at first I wondered why when they had so much going on, but eventually I figured it out.  Decent pay if you can stick it out, but way more stressful than it needs to be, and I'm not talking about the customers, an old man yelling at you for thirty minutes because his blu-ray stopped working is nothing compared to not knowing if you're going to be fired that week because you had a sick day three months ago and your calls aren't short enough.;Act less like the captains of a sinking ship.;2;1;;1,5;4;1;7

Well, that never happened. We were all strung along, some of us were fired, but by the time six months came along only 30 of the remaining 250 temp employees were given health insurance. they kept telling us, ""maybe next month."" When I finally quit and told them why, I was told that they were using benefits as a performance motivator, and they extended the conversion time frame to a year. I told them that health insurance is something that GOOD employers give their employers, not a performance motivator, and that they needed to find a better way to motivate their employees.

I was there for 7 months, my stats were in the top 10% of the center, and twice I was told they will convert me next time. The management is really messing up. At the time I left there were 525 reps, and of that more then 200 were temps. The real reason they are not converting anyone right now is because they are cutting costs where they can. This company treats employees like cattle. There is no Growth potential, they do hire all supervisors from the outside.

36363;netflix;Hillsboro, OR; Mar 18, 2012;Current  ;Customer Service Representative II;Started off great and degraded from a very positive culture to your typical production line call center.;Great pay, good benefits and an annual bonus package to pay for benefits with the option to pocket what you do not use. Decent hourly rate of pay for the industry.;Schedule changes based purely on performance with no regard to personal needs, including family or school schedules. Court ordered child visitation is also not recognized. When this was brought to management during the last shift bid it was made clear that there were no personal accommodations being made everything was purely performance based. No annual reviews and or raises. No vacation pay, if you are able to get time off approved you are expected to cover it out of pocket. When ill management will use various tactics to make you feel guilty about not coming in to work.;Treat all of your employees equally. There are currently 2 internal sites, one runs using the original Netflix values, the other is run like a typical turn and burn call center. Allowing some flexibility in schedules puts less stress on your employees, also vacation pay and allowing time off would help reduce the amount of turnover that happens and would also keep employees happier and more productive. This would also reduce the cost of having to train more employees. Also taking feedback from your employees about conditions would also improve morale by making your employees heard.;2;1;;2;3,5;2;4
36364;netflix;Hillsboro, OR; Apr 4, 2012;Former  ;Customer Service Representative;Absolutely terrible and soul-crushing;Free bananas, apples, coffee. Low priced soda. Free Netflix account. I worked with (not for!) some amazing people. If your supervisor likes you, you will be treated very well and have some degree of leniency when it comes to meeting stats and time spent on the phone.;"Pretty much everything else not noted above. Most days the ""What's working?"" list is shorter than the ""What's broken?"" one.  No communication between departments. Customer service is forced to make things up because the Netflix ""engineering"" or ""research"" teams dont give any sort of information to the reps regarding estimated time to service restoration during outages. I put engineering and research in quotes because, as a CSR, you never actually speak to them. They are merely referenced, like mythology or fairy tales.  Reps are given goals that are nearly impossible to consistently meet, in what I believe to be a fairly obvious system that gives Netflix an opportunity to fire virtually any employee for not hitting their metrics. You basically are there by the grace of your boss, if they want to find a reason to get rid of you it will be fairly easy for them to do so.  The customer dissatisfaction is worded in such a way that many people are leaving feedback on Netflix, not the individual rep, but this DSAT number must be below a certain percentage or you risk losing your job. You are basically encouraged to burn through as many calls as quickly as possible, placating the customer or flat out lying to them (blaming their ISP, home network, or device manufacturer) enough that they'll be compelled to say that they're satisfied after you say ""please stay on the line for a one question survey"" and then promptly hang up on them.  There is absolutely no way that you are going to have consistent, quality interactions in 4:30 minutes or less, ESPECIALLY after the missteps that Netflix has made this year. But if your numbers drop, or you spend too much time trying to help out, be prepared to be ""coached"".  Coaching is such an absurd term, because it implies that there is a sort of team camaraderie or human aspect. My last coaching session with my boss involved being told that I was not giving my all. I was only supposed to be a contractor for 59 days. I was supposed to have health insurance by now, and some security as an employee. Instead we are told that they can only afford to hire on so many people, and better luck next time, but you're welcome to stay on as a temp if you like! So yes, I dont really feel like giving my all. Despite putting in consistently good numbers, multiple people on my team have told me (independently) that they are afraid of being fired at any time.  I get the feeling that many people are there only until they find something else. Netflix was actually a considerable pay cut from my last job, but even if the pay was higher the way they treat their employees is at the top of the list of the worst employers I've ever personally experienced. Work / life balance is non-existent. While going through some personal issues in my life, my supervisor told me to ""leave it behind me"" when I walked in the door, not offering anything close to a compassionate response.  One last observation: the people I've noticed who seem to be TRULY happy there are the ones who are too young to know any better. I'm not old by any means, but I'm also not an 18-24 year old kid who doesn't realize that jobs dont need to be like this, that you can actually be treated like a human being and be *inspired* to perform, rather than doing it because you fear for your job on a daily basis. Eventually Netflix will chew them up and spit them out, too. Ask yourself why anyone should give loyalty to a company where an employee celebrating a 6 month anniversary is considered a veteran?  Also, the positive reviews on here are probably left by Netflix management. It cites things they dont even offer anymore at the Hillsboro facility (like free mac&cheese, and, oh I dunno, BENEFITS for most of the people here). You will most likely be a temp with Netflix (meaning no benefits) until you quit or get fired.  I've been lucky enough to work for some truly amazing companies, and Netflix is definitely not one of them.";"This is simple. Learn to communicate. Start treating your CSRs like human beings. Stop encouraging CSRs to lie to customers. Tucking tail and rescinding your decision to split the company doesn't magically make you a ""feedback driven company"", it means that you got called out on BS and you're backpedalling.";1;1;;1;2,5;1;9

36366;netflix;Los Gatos, CA; Feb 12, 2012;Former  ;Anonymous Employee;Can be fun, can be awful;It was an interesting experience working at Netflix. I was lured by the supposedly high talent density, solving great customer focused problems and bringing entertainment to people around the world at an absolutely unprecedented scale. I thought that technology would be used to solve difficult problems but in the end the problems to be solved are all around content, content, content. It is fun, though, to work at Netflix. The company is extremely open and transparent with data, decisions and the overall direction of the company. There are no secrets. It is very refreshing to see such an attitude, compare that to Apple.;Yes, there are interesting things to solve in cloud computing but discovery, search, personalization, and the overall architecture of the Netflix website can only be described as patchwork. The people who are working on these services are stuck in their ways and are protecting their personal little kingdoms. Netflix used to be leading when it comes to personalization and other discovery mechanisms. It has lost its ways and now those areas are a few years behind the competition. On a related note Netflix praises itself to have extremely talented people. This might have been the case but the talent density is certainly not the same as it used to be. A lot of the good people left recently and a lot of the deadwood hangs around because they will never be able to get a comparable salary elsewhere. There are the occasional firings going on but that is just scratching the surface. Because Netflix does not believe in career development (active or through mechanisms like 20% time) for their people it is hard to keep up with the competition.;Have a really close look at the talent in the company. There are a lot of people who are making architectural decisions who really shouldn't. Also while content is important discovery, personalization, search, etc. are equally important.

Two week training adequately prepares you for position. Nice break area with complementary tea, coffee, fruit. No dress code. Wear whatever you're comfy in. Friendly co-workers. Pleasant work space- comfortable desks, chairs, clean appearance. Breaks are CSR responsibility. You have a schedule, but you decide whether it's best to go on break or take one more call. On extremely high call volume days (i.e. server crashes, etc.) managers show appreciation by coming around with a cart of beverages and snacks to keep you going.;While you are placed on teams to help you deal with any obscure technical issues that may arise, the teams aren't very supportive or responsive. They love to BS in the chatroom, but when someone asks a real question suddenly it seems like no one is home. On the rare occasions when you do have an escalated call that you can not resolve, supervisors avoid your messages in order to avoid dealing with the dissatisfied customer.  There is very little positive feedback. On days when I did everything correctly - 0% customer dissatisfaction (by survey response), low handle times, etc., the supervisor never said a word. The moment you have a long call that pushes your time up, they call you on it. Regarding any such poor performance: it was very common for embarrassment tactics to be used in response instead of constructive criticism.;Find better ways to recognize your good employees. It's disheartening to continually get good stats and never get a pat on the back. The silly workplace contests are nice, but the employees recognize them for what they are.  Get a better system in place for checking in on your supervisors, or a report system.

Sure, you can take ""as much time off as you want"" if you dont mind spending that time worrying about if you'll have a job when you get back, or hell... even getting the time to take a vacation at all. The culture of fear is VERY real. There is zero work life balance. When I started I was suprised to see so many 30 somethings who were single and had no kids. I learned quickly that it's almost the only way to keep your job. 60 hours a week doesn't work when you have a family or even a significant other, especially when what precious time you do have off you are worried about work. Feedback is relative to who is giving it. I received my first real feedback session after I interviewed for a position 6 months after being hired.

Product is loved by most customers, and available just about everywhere. Competition is behind. Clear leader in unlimited streaming.;Senior leadership very confused. Communication from the top done very poorly. Lots of knee-jerk reactions and fire drills. Software complexity is very high, but cross functional coordination is poor. Poor management of growth. Lots of really bad decisions made. Hired too fast in 2010-2011 (and added too many mediocre managers), and now they are paying the price.;Break up the old boys club and bring in skilled senior management from the outside who know how to run a global company at scale. Engineering talent is good, but current management is lacking ability to handle the company's growth and properly leverage the talent.;3;3,5;;3,5;4,5;1;5
36373;netflix;Los Gatos, CA; Nov 23, 2011;Current  ;Senior Software Engineer;Revisiting my review after working here for a while. There are better, rewarding careers out there.;It's a decent JOB (emphasis on purpose) if you are looking for a heads down, monotonous coding job. If you can manage a decent amount of work and the perspective, you will have a stable pay check.;I was sold on all the culture stuff and drank the cool-aid at first. After spending a lot f time at Netflix, my perspective has changed for the worse. What good is the sales pitch if you can't deliver.  Some organizations are terrible (i am not talking about IT/ back-office type group) when it comes to recognizing people, allowing (forget about encouraging) their growth. No carrer, no recognition. In a way, its a career dead-end. Its a JOB.  Recent break-neck hiring has bought in a TON of managers (e.g. instead of bringing in 1 project manager, they've hired >1 managers). Believe it or not, it takes 4 times the amount of meetings (compared to 2 years ago at Netflix) to get 1/2 of what we used to get done in the same period of time.  Today, all of the talk about culture (except firing people for no good reason), freedom etc are just BS.  No family insurance (medical, dental etc). Company only pays for the employee but in reality, they dont care.;Apparently, top management (who've been at Netflix forever) thinks engineers who's been at Netflix for more than a couple of years is ineligible move into a management role because they won't be able to hire people. Seriously. Again, this seems to be applied differently in different organizations.  i would love to hear from the management about what data they have to back this up this bs.  Another career killer: Hire people who 'know' their job i.e. an engineer converting to a manager means that person has to 'learn' how to be a manager. Given all the recent (Q4 2011) news about Netflix, decide for yourself about the management 'knowing'.;2;3,5;;1;3;2,5;16

When people are let go, they are surprised. People are afraid to make mistakes, which makes for a stressful enviroment. I have never felt comfortable working there.

My Netflix experience so far is that if you're smart and get stuff done, you will be appreciated and rewarded. If you're looking for hand-holding, this is not the place for you. But if you're entrepreneurial, self-motivated and like challenging the status quo, then Netflix is a great place to work.; so far other than the commute. The lunches get a bit repetitive, but who's complaining when they bring it in for free? OK, I suppose it would be nice if they didn't always have meetings during the lunch hour, but that's about the biggest complaint I have - and I dont even really mind.;Keep hiring great talent and encouraging them to take smart risks.

36380;netflix;Hillsboro, OR; Sep 1, 2011;Former  ;Anonymous Employee;Quit, before you're fired.;Netflix does have some great benefits. They offer hourly employees a good starting wage, the break room is stocked with snacks, and employees receive a free Netflix plan. As an exempt employee the wages are great, much better than other companies. The freedom to take time off as you'd like is great, it's unlimited for exempt employees.;"If you accept a job at Netflix, you'll probably be pretty happy at first. You'll feel liberated by how much ""freedom and responsibility"" you're given. You'll be allowed to complete things without much as far as guidelines and you'll be allowed to work from home if you'd like. However, as soon as you complete something that someone doesn't like, you'll feel differently. Your first mistake could easily be your last. There aren't second chances and no one is safe from being ""let go"". My advice to prospective Netflix employees: have a savings and jump ship as soon as you can. It's only a matter of time before you're asked to go to a conference room and find yourself starring at a red Netflix packet...";Wake up and start treating people right...what goes around, comes around;2;1,5;;3;2,5;3;17
36381;netflix;Hillsboro, OR; Aug 15, 2011;Current  ;Anonymous Employee;Networking + Not Screwing Up = Another Paycheck;Pay for the qualifications is above average, upper management does a pretty good job of taking executive initiatives (not in sync with reality of call center at times) and implementing them to meet goals with minimal moral-related blowback given the abnormally lofty expectations at Los Gatos. Opportunity to advance and stay challenged for a call-center environment is above average...catch 22 of this is listed below.;In this company, what you know and who you know go hand in hand. Floor management is given independence to run their teams their way, provided they hit goals and dont draw too far outside the lines. This in some ways creates a public school environment: Some teachers inspire their students...some make them want to drop out entirely. From the top down there is a constant but rather inconsistent level of pressure to perform or face termination. When there is a lull in customer volume, employees are given adequate time and support to develop their skills...if the volume spikes unexpectedly however, external pressure related to the bottom line overrules, and suddenly everyone in the center is under the guillotine again. As an employee that has seen 80% of the center (now 900 strong) replaced with fresh meat in only a years time, and a large number of those let go having equal or better performance than my own (networking is key), it is frustrating to see so much talent go to waste on a regular basis as a result of a supervisor's<team manger's<director's<corp exec's own stress to perform-or-face-a-similar-fate mentality. Going back to the Pros, you can advance rapidly if you make people notice the positive things you do at the right time, because every level in the hierarchy drops like flies.;"SLOW DOWN and don't lose your center! When you have potential competitors with pocketbooks 1000x the size I realize this is difficult, but it is not a positive position to be in from an internal culture standpoint. If expansion continues without re-evaluation of what makes the company worth working for other than the paycheck, you will exhaust your talent pool, be forced to outsource, and turn into just another company with a generic, pre-programmed message: ""What other choice do you have?""";4;2,5;;3;4,5;5;8

Which in all honesty I was happy to do, I got to work with some really rad people, and do really great work that I'm proud of. However, karma is, well you know karma is, and I let go of a lot of people that probably felt like it wasn't fair, and eventually the same thing happened to me. Loyalty to employees is not one of their strong suits.";Honestly have the greatest respect for the management in terms of their abilities to do their jobs.

I knew one of the first 6 people to open the center, and she had been laid off over a year prior to when I started. She had some horror stories, but I thought the pay would overshadow any hint of doubt I had.  I made them aware of the fact that I was in school [college, obviously] prior to being invited to the interview, and they said that was fine & they'd work with me (I found out later that this is a complete lie). I went through training and everything with positive feedback. Only after that did it become an issue, and I was constantly pulled aside and berated. I am not going to quit school to slave away at a job that will last less than a year. They pulled me into random rooms around the call center and told me my ""internet browsing privileges were being taken away during my breaks,"" because I looked up Netflix reviews. I was told that my face looked ""sad and depressed."" Well, of course it was after you pulled me into a room 3 times in one day trying to make me feel bad about going to school.  They expect you to talk to 85-year-olds with Alzheimers that can't even remember their email address, let alone their name, and help them fix whatever issue they have in less than 5 minutes.  Why is there free food? Why are there showers here? Why are there laptops for you to use? Because they want you to eat, sleep and breathe Netflix.";People are human. Netflix has no human aspect to it. When I first started, everyone there was worried about their job, although most of them were recently promoted. That's horrible. Start investing in people so you don't waste money on training.  Don't say things that can bring a lawsuit to your door.  Don't hire people in school.

Reed rocks, but some of the others are average/good, not exceptional.";"In almost two years at Netflix: Some people LOVE working at Netflix, some cautiously tolerate it. Too much of this is dependent on whether they're working for a competent manger that is assumed to properly apply the ""high performance culture"" philosophy.  The desire to streamline HR by getting rid of almost all policies and procedures means no ""professional development"" for your management teams. There needs to be a level of education for new managers (hired and promoted. Don't assume everyone ""get's it"" in order to make sure the ""high performance culture"" is properly applied. Done right, people will know what's expected of them, get regular feedback from their managers, and KNOW if they're on the short list for being let go as business needs change. They can react to this and either adapt or anticipate why they're getting a severance package. For most employees, Netflix is a short-term roller-coaster ride with options to ride again for those who enjoy it. When someone exits the ride, you want them leaving with a smile and the civil handshake, not a brick to the head and a just a check to cushion the pain.  I've been lucky to work for a manger who's awesome, and I've been having a great time.

36395;netflix;Los Gatos, CA; Apr 2, 2011;Current  ;Engineering Manager;The Right Place If You Are The Right Fit;"So far I am incredibly impressed with Netflix. This is by far the highest concentration of smart people I have ever seen at one company and I have worked in Silicon Valley for over 20 years at large and small companies. In addition, not only are they smart but also very helpful and ego free. I read the culture slide deck before I started but wondered if they actually ""walked the walk"". I've found the answer to that question to be ""absolutely"".  If you are not a really smart, driven person who can operate completely independently and with little direction from management, then you will not be happy or successful at Netflix. There is no hand holding, and expectations are high. But if you are the kind of person that craves lots of freedom and responsibility than you will love it.  In the period of time I've been here, I have personally seen several people get promoted from engineers to managers and from managers to directors. There is a lot of career growth as the company is growing like gangbusters right now and if you are great you will love it and thrive.";If you are looking for safety and worried that you won't get another job somewhere else, Netflix is not the place for you. Basically, Netflix operates like a Startup company. There is no hand holding, you have to make lots of important decisions on your own, you have to be proactive about seeking out help and information, and the culture is fast paced and filled with lots of people who would be the smartest guys in the room at other companies. At Netflix the whole room is filled with those guys. If that intimidates you or scares you, thats a sign its not a good fit for you. If that lights you up and excites you, then you will love working at Netflix.;Its going to be a challenge to preserve the unique culture as the company grows.

36398;netflix;Los Gatos, CA; Feb 11, 2011;Former  ;Manager;Don't make the mistake of working here;1. Pay is good, and for some tough to fill roles, pay is very good. 2. The stock option plan is a good deal. 3. A number of policies treat people like adults (dress code, attendance, and vacation/holidays). You can take as much time off as you want, as long as you get your job done. 4. A number of smart people get hired. 5. The industry is growing very fast. 6. Well known brand with instant street recognition. 7. Facilities are pretty good.;1. Look at the comments on this site around turnover, treating people poorly, sick culture, and weak senior leadership. These are all very accurate. 2. No training, management training, or development. The philosophy is if you donÉ??t have what we need, we will replace you (i.e., fire you for not being a É??good fitÉ?ù) with someone from the outside who has that. 3. Hourly jobs in particular have stagnant pay. 4. There are no bonuses or incentives. 5. The culture has serious problems. ∂ˇ∂ˇa. You will see countless references on this site to a É??culture of fearÉ?ù. This is widespread in every department and division. Even executives laugh that their time is numbered. A company that functions on fear is not a place for the long term. When everyone in a room is asked do they fear being fired and everyone says yes, that is a big problem. ∂ˇ∂ˇb. A culture of watching your back and stabbing others in the back. Many employees, including C level people, participate and have learned that tossing others under the bus, keeps them safe. They see this as a way to protect themselves from scrutiny from above. Employees and managers are all too comfortable talking about what is not working with a person. The 360 review process reinforces this. Those who have been there the longest are almost soulless with regard to firings. They have fired or seen so many people let go that they donÉ??t really care anymore. 6. You can be fired without warning, feedback, or any coaching. Most employees donÉ??t bring any personal belongings to work as they could be let go at any moment. It is often a surprise. 7. Do not move for a job with Netflix. If your partner or spouse doesnÉ??t work, you could be risking your families financial health. There is no job security regardless of how good you are. Performance does not equal security at Netflix. 8. Managers have a 1 year shelf life before they get shown the door. Directors and VPs are constantly evaluating managers, so anytime you make a mistake, are perceived not to be cutting edge, it could be your turn. 9. HRÉ??s job is to hire and show people the door. HR brags about how good they are at firing people. They donÉ??t help employees, nor are they there to help employees become better. Their role is simply to ensure the company doesnÉ??t get sued and headhunt for all the people that are turning over. 10. Managers main role is making their team better through constrantly looking for their weaker employees. Leaders are asked could they hire someone better. Of course the answer will always be yes. 11. No severance package is enough to compensate you for disruption in your career, moving, or the stress that comes without having a job. 12. The recruiting function will hire you fast. The idea is to keep you excited, but if you are reading this donÉ??t get caught up in the Netflix product of moviesÉ??look at whether this is actually a place you want to work. 13. ItÉ??s incredibly stressful and life-shortening for you and your loved ones. Why work at a place where people, including your hiring managers, treat you as completely disposable?;1. Change out your HR leadership. They are in love with the culture, but they are creating an unhealthy long term environment. Once the economy picks up you will not be able to treat people as poorly as you do. 2. Change the culture of fear.

People are not given the time to learn, make mistakes and grow from the mistake, instead one mistake (even small) will get you shown to the door. There is no training and even high powered professionals need some direction and guidance. There is a lot of fear and uncertainty inherent in the culture and it leads to an ""every man for himself"" culture which does not promote teamwork.";HR 101, your employee's are your greatest asset and constant turnover is not healthy for any business in the long run.;1;2;;1;4,5;1;12

36403;netflix;Hillsboro, OR; Oct 28, 2010;Current  ;Customer Service Representative;Netflix as a service is great, but I don't recommend them as an employer, at least, not at the Hillsboro call center.;Like many of the reviews have already said, Netflix does offer some nice employee benefits, especially the employee stock purchase program (take a look at what Netflix stock has been doing, the last couple of years - you'll wish you'd bought in 2007)  I've met some great people while working there, both peers and supervisors.  For the most part, customer support is incredibly easy, because the service itself works pretty smoothly. When it doesn't, CS reps have the power to make things right for customers, which is fabulous.  Unlimited time off (within reason, and when it's available) is awesome.;"Ultimately, the cons outweigh the pros. I will be voluntarily leaving Netflix for a new job in the very near future.  Netflix treats employees like they're completely expendable. I realize that no one is indispensable to a company, but Netflix uses up employees like I use up tissues when I have a cold. The turnover is ridiculous, and it doesn't have to be that way.  For CS reps, the main statistic used to determine our ""worthiness"" is the DSAT. Customers get asked a simple question after contacting customer service: ""Were you satisfied with the call?"" A ""no"" response counts against the rep, even if it was something the rep couldn't control (I'm sorry, it looks like your bank declined your card for this month's service fee.), or the customer was making an unreasonable demand (I got a disc that won't play! Give me six months of free service or I'm cancelling!). Netflix's stance is that we should be able to sugar-coat bad news so well that the customer doesn't hang up unhappy. This method of measurement is incredibly flawed and has led to reps ""gaming"" the system to avoid ""no"" responses.  Netflix does not give raises. Period. Not for cost of living, not for length of time employed, not even for outstanding performance. I have worked there 3+ years and my stats have been stellar the whole time. So stellar, I'm one of the people they have trainees shadow, to hear how to handle calls properly. I have *never* gotten a raise. Monetarily, Netflix considers my value to be the same as a new hire who just got out of training.  No paid time off. (Unless I want to take a pay cut and bank that toward paid time off.)  Mandatory overtime during the holidays. (They're promising it won't happen again this year, but that's what they said last year ... and we had mandatory overtime for three months last winter. And the winter before.)  Extremely limited career options - unless you want to be a CS supervisor, you're pretty much out of luck at the call center.  Narrow-focus hiring - Netflix hires people with EXACTLY the skills they need for a particular position. If that position goes away, so does the person. There is very little provision for cross-training or retraining a good employee to fit them in somewhere else.  TRaSE - one exception to the cross-training policy has been TRaSE, which is a disaster, so far. TRaSE combined the department that handles streaming tech support escalations with the department that handles loss prevention: billing fraud, shipping issues, physical inventory problems and website content issues. They all received cross-training, and even though there's more people to handle problems now, CS reps can never get a response when they have an urgent loss prevention issue. Reps have to tell customers ""someone will get back to you within 1-3 business days."" What happened to ""one call resolution""? There's a guaranteed ""no"" response for my DSAT. Thanks a lot.  Workforce Management can't seem to forecast how much staff is needed, we will have weeks where they offer to let reps go home early every day, and then a couple of weeks later, they're offering voluntary extra hours and begging people to stay after their shifts. This is probably related to the fact that Marketing doesn't feel like they need to let anyone know about promotions until the last minute.  Speaking of Marketing, they dont seem to feel a need to ask anyone what kind of impact various promotions will have on the rest of Netflix's operations. The ""no credit card necessary for a free trial"" promo was a fiasco, much of which could have been avoided by asking some seasoned reps a few key questions.  The same can be said about some of the ""tests"" that Engineering sets up on the website. Isn't it logical to maybe ask a few questions of the people who actually talk to the customers before you try something out? I realize that we need to find out what works and what doesn't, but if a ""test"" makes the service unusable or unpalatable for a customer and they call to complain, CS reps can't remove them from the ""test"". Netflix is willing to lose the customer because that's a valid ""test result"". There has to be a better way.  The Canadian service was launched prematurely, in my opinion. Many of the calls we get from Canadian customers center on the lack of content, especially newer releases. The Canadian streaming library will grow, just like the US library, but that's not a satisfying answer to Canadian customers. Thanks for another ""no"" response on my DSAT, Marketing department!";The service works so well. Figure out a way to make your human resources department work at least half as well. You are losing good employees at a ridiculous rate, which is going to start affecting customer satisfaction, and ultimately, your bottom line. Dealing with the general public is stressful enough, your outstanding employees shouldn't have to deal with unfair treatment from you, as well.;2;3;;1;3;2;20

He has no idea what he is doing and is making decisions that will hurt the call center. There are few people who respect him as a leader and we look to our Managers for guidance. There is no clear direction and even though they talk about coaching their people it is not true. The coaching has no impact and people are fired due to not being supported properly. There are so many other Supervisors looking for jobs because they cannot stand it there. I cannot wait to get a new job. Attrition there is so high.

36415;netflix;Los Gatos, CA; Jun 15, 2010;Former  ;Great Service But Not Great A Place for A Career;Three works can summarize the culture at Netflix. : Culture of Fear.;Netflix base salaries are high. Engineers are all very senior. The buildings are beautiful and having onsite expresso machines is wonderful. The location near Los Gatos is great. Everyone outside of Netflix understands and loves the service which is a pretty big perk.;Netflix is the first place I've worked where you can get fired for doing too good of a job. Managers are always changing usually as a result of being shown the door. The constant turnover leads to another problem in that there is not much domain expertise in the systems built in Netflix because of the high turnover.  There is no career growth in Netflix. What you are hired for is more than likely what you will be doing for your stay at the company which on average is only a couple of years. There are cases where engineers / managers morph into something different but it was very rare.  Box lunches are provided but they are terrible. That food is not meant for human consumption. A variety of vendors would be nice.  The unlimited vacation policy is touted as a key benefit but watch out. Constantly changing priorities and short deadlines along with no job overlap means you are going to be able to take that nice vacation to take.  The compensation is skewed in that there are no bonuses or stock grants for the rank and file employees. Insurance for anything beyond the employee ( significant other / family ) will be passed along to the employee. In many cases I've heard this can pretty expensive.  I will say that I did have some good times at Netflix. If you are considering it as a company do your homework, ask the right questions, and make sure you weigh the pros and cons of the environment.;Fix the culture. While there has been a steady stream of engineers and managers to choose from times have gotten better and there are other choices. Netflix could be so much more if you valued your employees, focused less on the short term distractions, and invest more on making employees love the work environment in the same way everyone loves the Netflix service.;2;1,5;;1;3;1,5;23

36417;netflix;Los Gatos, CA; Jul 5, 2010;Former  ;Senior Software Engineer;Fear-based culture;Higher than market salary Free lunches Unlimited PTO;Fear-based, highly competitive culture driven by upper management. Mid-management is forced to follow the suit otherwise it will be their job on the line. Everyone is under pressure to deliver but nobody provides guidance as to what is expected. If you're a super-star you're supposed to figure it out on your own. Zero tolerance to even small mistakes - you're expected to work as a perfect robot. If you made a mistake you're out immediately, no chance for correction. Zero communications about your performance - it is all up to management to decide how you're doing. So you dont know whether you made or making mistakes. Project management does not exist, hence no planning is happening, just loose email exchanges. You dont feel as part of the team, there are virtually no teams, just people trying to prove something and keep their jobs. As a result many decisions are short-sited since they provide immediate credit, long-term decisions are usually on back-burner until all of a sudden they become critical and then it is all hands on deck. You're expected to work long hours and weekends on regular basis. Basically if you accepted an offer you're owned by Netflix. Documentation is non-existent, people are secretive about knowledge transfer. All in all Netflix's motto Freedom comes with Responsibility turns into the situation when company has freedom to do whatever it wants and employees have all responsibilities.;Trust and respect people. The fact that you pay high salaries and provide unlimited PTO does not mean that you own people's lives. Give people freedom for mistake, at least one.

She was fired without explanation after 360 reviews. My second TM was present during all team meetings but was usually busy on a laptop IM'ing with someone else rather than participating.  Even during my firing she was on her phone texting. I was given no information outside of a prepared packet and was asked to sign zero paperwork. I was escorted from the building like a criminal and the only reason anyone knew I had left was because of a pre-written email I was able to send when I returned to my desk to gather my things. Fear for your job makes you write an exit email months before you loose your job;Speak to your employees! Don't treat adults like they are children. TM's should give Supervisors the ability to make decisions about their teams rather than having to go through multiple people to get an answer. Give good feedback along with bad.

I exceeded all metrics, trained new hires, and monitored the team chat for assisting on calls. People who have worked there for 2 years have never gotten a raise.  In addition to the above, I found the people there to be extremely unhealthy. Netflix offers food in the break room, but all of it is cheap with high sodium levels and MSG. simply add water, heat and serve. I'll pass.  The customers can also be downright abusive at times.

There are some good people that you meet here, however they are usually fired within a matter of months. It is a challenging environment to work in.;The hours are very poor. There is no chance for promotion unless you are part of the current in crowd. The culture that is created is one that promotes arrogance, aggressive behavior and dishonesty. The general feeling is of fear and anxiety amongst the employees. You do not receive a performance review until you have upset management. You are expected to perform at such a level of intensity that it creates extremely high tension, associates tremble with fear. You are flat out told that you are expendable, and no matter how hard you try or what you accomplish, you will likely end up being walked out the door once they find someone who is not at the verge of a breakdown to replace you.;Management should consider the fact that by promoting and encouraging anti-social behavior the company is setting itself up for disaster. While people should be self-motivated and strong, they should not be expected to work themselves to a point of breakdown.

36425;netflix;Los Gatos, CA; May 2, 2010;Former  ;Manager;Netflix: Culture of Fear;The pay is above market. Not a lot above market, but a bit above market. The drawback is there are absolutely no benefits to speak of (no health benefits, no training, no daycare) so that above market pay gets eaten up pretty fast by real world needs.;"A total fear of failure permeates the ranks. Netflix basically gives you a warning on your first mistake, and then fires you after your second mistake. This is why the annual turnover rate is well over 20%. Since there is an entirely new set of employees every few years, nobody knows what process to follow, and everything is chaotic. HR solves this by saying ""there is no process for anything! Make it up as you go along!"" Sure, if I fired all the employees every few years I'd stay away from process too.  The key problem is that with all the firings most employees spend the day simply trying to find cover. The ass covering at Netflix is legendary. Nobody wants to innovate. Nobody wants to reach outside their comfort zone. Netflix has created a culture of fear, and the way in which they manage terminations reinforces the culture of fear (they immediately demonize the terminated employee, and try to make the termination serve as a lesson to others).  The culture of fear is so ingrained in Netflix that many managers only have one tool for managing their directs, and that is to threaten to fire them. There simply is no other process for managing poor performance (remember, there is no process - they will admit this to you if you ask).  And finally, the last thing you should be warned about is their ""high performance"" culture. Their justification for all the firings is that the fired employees weren't high performers. But since there is no process, no record-keeping, there is no objective measurement of performance. So ""high performers"" end up being the employees that get along with the boss and keep a low profile. ""High performers"" at Netflix are not employees that take risks, interact with outside groups, or produce a high volume of work.  Netflix loves to talk about high performance but they have the lowest standard for high performance that I've ever seen. They are completely happy to manage with fear, however. If you put those two insane concepts together you end up with a rather hysterical environment.";So you guys did one thing well, a long time ago, and you've been marginally improving that business (DVD rental) ever since. Your astoundingly high turnover rate worked in that world, because all the processes were in place. But now you are trying to get into the streaming business, and that business only runs with knowledge workers at the helm. And guess what? Knowledge workers are pretty well-connected. The word is out that Netflix does not value its employees and as a result it's going to be harder and harder to staff your new ventures. You really need to find the groups at Netflix with the highest turnover and keep those managers away from the streaming business. You have some managers that simply do not know how to manage, they only know how to fire and hire. As much as you love to say that firing and hiring is what management is all about, you could not be more wrong. Find the teams with low turnover, they are the teams that work in spite of your chaotic work environment.;1;2;;1;3;1;49

Average life expectancy in this office is about 2 years, which means very often the main knowledge base of a department exists when an employee is terminated (not always for fair reasons) or chooses to leave since there is no room to grow. There are conflicting values and many managers dont practice what Netflix preaches. If you associate with the right people, this can help your career, but it is disappointing that office politics factors so heavily into a company that preaches how different they are from other corporate cultures. Yes, it's great we all get Blackberries or iPhones (and are reachable 24/7) and have a liberal vacation policy, but the aura of paranoia that invades the office due to the frequent restructurings is not conducive to successful business practices.;The culture in the main headquarters in San Jose is different and very disconnected from the BH office.

The emphasis on corporate values is commendable. Customers love Netflix and will give you positive strokes when they find out you work there. Pay raises are based on merit - individual contributers are rank ordered by managers and higher ranked individuals get paid more. It is very open - make time to exploit that learning opportunity and it can be like graduate level training in web engineering. Unsurpassed attention to the user experience. Business decisions are data driven. Scientific methodology applied to most engineering decisions. Generate a testable hypothesis and a way to test it, and if it pans out your idea could soon be used by millions. Fail fast is the mantra. The CEO is whip smart. Overall it is very well run.;Follow some of the highly promoted corporate values at your peril -- pure selflessness and candor will get you in trouble during 360 review time. The 360 process is supposedly intended only to help you by providing valuable feedback, but it is used to cull the pack. Elicit feedback on your own well before the review process begins so you have time for course correction. There is high turnover, especially during the few months after the 360 reviews are published. Many are shoved, but many top notch people leave of their own volition. People who seem to be highly valued and an integral part of the work culture will one fine day simply disappear. They hire mostly specialists and maintain a very lean team. Competency alone does not suffice for job security. They will let people go once their project is completed if there is no immediate need for their specialty. They pay very well, but load engineers with high amounts of work. Because the dev team is kept so lean, there is little opportunity for moving to a different group and there are few growth opportunities. It is highly political in the management ranks and lots of jockeying for position, surprise surprise.

The constant measurement of progress, and high expectations can be stressful. Time off is very difficult to imposssible to get off unless you plan months a head. Currently there is no availble time off for the rest of the year. The team managers (my supervisors supervisors) seem to be less compentent than many of the team supervisors. No advancement outside of the call center, and the advancement within the call center is pretty competative. Also the ""company values"" of taking invoation from anywhere in the company is a little bit of BS. I and others have made recomendations that dont leave the call center to corprate. I have even been told by a team manager to not waste my time thinking of call drivers or to come up with ideas as ""people with advanced degrees are already doing that.""";Reevaulate the team manager positions. I believe most are a hold over from when the call center was ran less well a few years back. I would love some other outlets of employment provided to those within the call center.

I used to have a competent supervisor who would help me when I needed it and who knew I was competent enough to handle most things. Now I have a supervisor who knows that I've been here two years and that my scores consistently put me in the top 50 performers ... but she tries to get out of taking escalations by giving me ""tips"" to de-escalate and telling me to go back to the customer with some compromise they've already declined. (Gee ... I think I have a good handle on how to de-escalate a call by now. If I'm asking my supervisor to take the call, I've done everything I can and the customer has asked for the manager. Just take the flippin' call, because sending me back onto the phone will just make the customer angrier and make sure they give a ""no"" response on that customer satisfaction survey. Awesome.)  This latest re-org seemed to be completely geared toward shaking up teams that had just gotten into their groove, my old team had great combined scores and even though most of our shifts didn't change all that radically, we all got split up.

Netflix does not have a policy regarding sick days so as to hold it against you when you cannot make it to work (even if you provide a doctor's note). In nine months I called out sick twice and still received warnings not to miss work. Netflix promotes itself as striving to have the best customer service, however has reduced it's training too only two weeks. One week in classroom and the next week on the floor taking calls. The training is insufficiect which leads to inconsistency on the call center floor and the information which is relayed to customers. The turn over rate is ridiculous. I managed to work there for nine months before my part time shift was taken away and forced to go full time. I was not able to work full time due to childcare needs and was told that either I take the shift I am given (which is based on call volumes and business needs only) or I can quit. Netflix refused to work out a schedule that would let me keep my job there and work with their needs as well. Netflix anticipates doing a shift bid every six months, which means there is no gurantee you will be able to stay at the shift that you are hired for, and no room for disscussion. So if you have small children or attend school this is not a suitable job. Netflix promotes a no policy policy environment, which gives each individual team manager and leader to do as they see fit. One day they will tell you you are doing a great job, the next you will be let go. Netflix call center fired employees for not being able to make it to work due to snowstorms that hit hard in December 2008. Roads were not plowed, public transportation was not running, and yet you were let go. People were in accidents trying to get to work. Other's they put up in a hotel to make sure they would make their shift. Netflix had random mandatory OT in some cases without any notice. It wasn't just that they required a set amount of extra hours from everyone, they only had specific hours in which had to be filled. My husband had to take days off work so I could meet their required OT. Again no flexiblity with regards to family needs. Overall it's just really sad because this job was and could be fun. It's about movies and tv shows and all the great changes that are happening with the internet and instant streaming. Still it is a call center and those jobs aren't always the best, however when the entire company is working so hard against their own employess, the job is terrible. It's not even something you can count on because you dont know when they will fire you and for what.;Invest some more time in actually keeping decent employees instead of degrading everyone who works there. Most of the employees have college degrees and years of customer service experience. Netflix is known around the world for it's great service.

They have good snacks. They pay a pretty high cash salary. You get to claim that you're in the movie business.;"Netflix makes a big deal about their hiring policies. They claim that they regularly evaluate employee performance, and let the lowest performers go. To me, this sounded great! In contrast to many other companies where lazy and incompetent people hang around for years, Netflix tried to retain only the best and brightest people.  Unfortunately, that's not what it was like in reality. A week after I started at Netflix, the recruiter who hired me was unceremoniously dismissed. Then the tech support guy in our office was released. Then an engineer on my team. In each of these cases, it wasn't clear what these folks had done wrong. They had all been technically competent, friendly and hard working. This promoted a culture of fear where no one felt that their job was secure.  It turns out that there were several things going on. Managers were given incentives to regularly purge employees. So, managers developed antagonistic relationships with employees. In most normal companies, a key responsibility of a manager is to defend their team in front of senior management. At Netflix, this just doesn't happen.  Additionally, Netflix doesn't have adequate mechanisms for providing feedback and review to employees. (In the year I spent at Netflix, I didn't receive a single review, positive or negative.) Without a formal system for employee evaluation, managers resort to picking favorites: they hire in their friends, and fire people who they aren't friends with. I saw this happen to many different people while I was at Netflix. It's allowable by law (everyone is an ""at will"" employee), but it does not lead Netflix to hire and retain the best people.  Netflix has had the good fortune to be in an easy business. They moved early into online DVD rentals, and have large cost advantages over potential rivals. Their competitors (Blockbuster, Walmart, etc) took major missteps, and were not really able to compete. Netflix doesn't have to be the best at anything they do: operations, marketing, movie recommendations, etc. They just have to be OK at these things to run a profitable business, and they are only OK at them.";The key problem with Netflix is in their HR policies. Netflix needs to establish formal job responsibilities for all employees, establish goals for individuals, and measure employee performance against those goals.;1;3;;1,5;3;2,5;28
36485;netflix;Los Gatos, CA; Mar 9, 2009;Current  ;Senior Software Engineer;Great CEO, a lot to learn there, but some cultural flaws. Worth working for.;You are part of a team that is at the leading edge of a cool entertainment paradym. Reed Hastings, the CEO, is probably the CEO that I have most respected in my career, and I feel he pretty consistently makes good decisions and moves the company in the correct direction. Netflix has a very quantitative approach to almost everything, including detailed user testing for their products, so there is a lot to learn about that. The other employees are generally cool people, and fairly smart in general. The user interface aspects of the website are strong, so again, there is a learning opportunity. The company wide meetings are fun, and entail good communication.;In the website development group, there is two week development cycle. That means that there is a push to the website every two weeks. This has a few consequences. One is that there is a high percentage of overhead (testing and release stuff) compared to actual development time. There is not much time for software design in such a scheme, there is always a rush to hit the next two week time click. Longer term projects are tougher to schedule and short term thinking dominates. The performance policy is that anyone who, if they quit, would not be attempted to talk out if it, should be fired preemptively (a hair trigger threshold for firing, basically). This creates a chilling effect in my opinion. I have seen fairly senior management that disagreed with their boss being (farily apparently) fired. This creates a bit of a yes man environment, something that Netflix would deny (perhaps even to themselves). There is very little empowement of employees in real decisions, and decision making is very top down, with the resulting motivation hit that entails.;"Even going to a three week release cycle would help things a lot. The counter argument is that that would lead to more pressure to have inter-release ""patches"", but I think the overhead percentage would drop a lot (like 50%) and that owuld make it worth it (if you don't patch a bug for a 2 week cycle, do you really need to patch it for 3?

The culture puts high demands on everyone, and imparts great freedom and ownership in return.  Very data driven, customer focused, innovation oriented.;"The company is very focused, and so brand new areas and opportunities come rarely.

Self motivated people can have a great career experience. Netflix is filled with mature adults that are not politically motivated. Netflix management does a pretty good job of setting the proper context for employees and letting them run independently. Employees enjoy a culture of freedom and responsibility that few other companies offer. As an example, we have no vacation policy, you take what you need. If you are excessive or not performing at a great level, you will be called out on it.  If you are lucky enough to be offered a job at Netflix, take it, you wonÉ??t regret it.

There is a fair amount of career advancement available at the lower levels, but it is pretty thin at the upper levels such as director & vice president. Not sure the pat at or above market value for employees is 100% true in all cases.;In general, senior management has their act together pretty well.

This is largely due to management and the fact that the prevailing hiring and HR philosophies are not executed quite as they should be. Although management is generally on the mark in letting people go, there have been a few notable decisions that have not quite made sense. The review process leaves much to be desired, as it still does not accomplish the desired goal of identifying the ""rock stars"" and separating them from the less-productive. Also, it is very common for employees to be expected to carry the workload of several people, and action is usually only taken when something big ends up falling through the cracks.";Listen to your employees more, and be more in touch with personnel issues.

The company is on innovation time all the time. It's a very open culture with no questions asked if you work from home or take days off. People love Netflix and that makes it cool to work here. The company is adding subscribers and growing financially, which you gotta love in this economy. Employees get a free eight-out plan and get $1,000 towards travel expenses to the Sundance or LA Film Festival. You structure your salary as you want, dedicating a percentage or  at all to stock options. You get all your salary up front so there's no bonuses or incentive payments during the year.;You dont get a lot of compliments on a job well done because everyone is supposed to work at A+ level. The salary review is not tied to the performance review. Performance review allows anyone in the company to evaluate anyone and many people do it anonymously, which can be vindictive. The stock rises and falls like a yo-yo. Everyone is supposed to work in cubes but some people have had offices built for themselves or taken over a conference room for an office. There is two distinctive cultures at Netflix. One's in Los Gatos and the other's in LA.

Virtually no room to advance, it really is true that if you get promoted to anything you have a much higher probability of being fired.  The job was always highly enjoyable - trying to appease the revolving queue of managers... not so much. I got conflicting feedback (when any was given) depending on who I spoke to, on varying days of the week at times.  When I was hired, I was told about the ""high performance culture"" which was great for about a year. Everyone worked together, it felt good to work there, I was proud of what I was doing. If I had known that ""high performance culture"" was going to transform into a culture of fear, I would probably have taken a different job.";Do not burn through managers like they are kleenex. That does not help - it makes things worse. It is close to impossible to be managed at all when you don't have time to get to know your boss, and your boss doesn't know anything about you, or your performance.  Send a drone in to observe things from the customer service floor perspective, the way some of your people are being treated is absolutely inexcusable.

I wouldn't even say that SOME of the people are good while others somehow seemed to 'slip' in. If you aren't one of the best in your line of work, I dont think you'll ever get in the door here. I've been here for a number of years and have had the privilege to work with some extremely bright people. As an employee (and part of a team), its good to know that whatever you are working on is going to be top notch because of who is working on it.  Netflix also encourages you to learn and explore new technologies and expand your own knowledge base. At past companies this was always a problem. If something didn't directly relate to what you were working on... well you had to make excuses and come up with reasons why you wanted to try something new. At Netflix, they not only encourage it but really urge you to try to broaden your own skill set.  Our paid time off policy is not to be beat... Netflix has ! No two weeks a year or so many days off for personal/sick leave GARBAGE. Instead, you just tell your manager that you wanted to take three weeks off next month and he says, okay have a good time. We'll see ya when you get back! How cool is that?  Its all about Movies for me. I used to think I was a bit if a movie buff. Yeah, that was until I worked here and met real movie buff's. Meetings are filled with references to movies. In one of the team meetings I go to every week, you can count the number of Ferris Bueller's day off lines.  $$$ Show me the money. Netflix really does pay well! I left my old job doing the EXACT same thing I do here.. the only difference is, I make X2 as much!  I'd like to write more, but those reasons alone are pretty good.;"When I first started, the head of HR said ""Netflix is a high performance environment."" Often, I feel like they have confused ""high pressure"" with ""high performance"", and believe me, there is a difference. Sometimes I feel like they overly eggagerate the importance of SOME features. I mean, no one is going to die on the table here guys.. its just a movie rental company.  Our medical/health benefits are mediocre at best and HR doesn't seem to care that the majority of employees are totally dissatisfied with the offerings. After constant employee complaints on how high our benefit prices are, HR comes back with even higher prices this year while having even less coverage. I'm not buying the line they fed us either ""benefits are more expensive everywhere across the country."" Whatever.. if I gave that as an excuse why I didn't get a project completed on time, I'd be ""talked to"".  Every year, we have this total JOKE of a per review process (360 reviews). You HAVE to rate your peers and get ratings back from the people you asked to rate you. From my experience, its totally pointless and a huge waste of time / energy across the company. If we spent even a quarter of the time and money it takes to run, manage, and maintain this 360 review process, we'd have double the amount of movies in our Watch Instantly offering.  dont come here thinking you'll rise through the ranks! That just doesn't happen here. Yes, there are a few people who have started out as individual contributors and risen to the higher ranks but for the most part, I've watched very talented people leave Netflix to get management positions else where and Netflix doesn't really care. When you accept a job here, it will most likely be in the same position for the rest of your time at Netflix.  There is also a very big brother feel here.. Netflix HR is watching you. But maybe that's just me! People seem to 'disappear' sometimes!"; really. I have been very impressed with what direction the company is going. Decisions that I thought were misguided have really turned out well. My only real gripe with Netflix is Benefits and HR!;3;5;;3;2,5;5;8

Our CEO, Reed Hastings, happens to be one of the most brilliant and innovative leaders of the industry and he always has an open door policy to his employees.;It is extremely focused on the culture of its people. This is not exactly a downside but to certain individuals who are used to a structured corporate environment, this may not be the right place for them.;Continue to disseminate information to your subordinates and always try to deliver positive reinforcement.;5;5;;5;4,5;5;1

36530;netflix;Los Gatos, CA; Nov 16, 2008;Current  ;Engineering Director;Reed is a strong leader with a vision, and has gathered great people to help him make the vision real.;You should consider working at Netflix if you like to work with passionate and smart people in an environment almost devoid of politics. At Netflix, many decisions are data-driven. Collecting data to be able to be smart about the business is so ingrained into the culture and so obviously right that, after a while, one is amazed when friends or business partners in other companies tell you that it's not how it works in their world. There is a great sense of mutual respect among the people who work there. Things do change fast, and that can be a bit disconcerting if you dont like the thrill :-). On the other hand, hard, but necessary decisions are made promptly. If you're at a stage of your life where you want or must take it easy for a while, Netflix is not for you. The pace here does not allow for slacking, and you'll either stand out like a sore thumb, or you're pulled into the race.;"You will be spoiled by all the common sense that wafts through the hallways. Netflix is probably not right for you if you're looking for a big title (e.g. ""architect""). The organization is very flat, and there are not a lot of traditional career growth opportunities.

Best company I have worked for (25 year career). Loved by customers with a highly rated user experience that is tested by rigorous quantitative and qualitative analysis.";If you want a greenfield experience or the open-endedness of a start up then Netflix is not for you. Netflix is relentless on culling stuff that does not fit in the major focus. Some people might find that constraining (the rationale is focused on what works best for users).

36540;netflix;Los Gatos, CA; Sep 5, 2008;Current  ;Web QA Manager;;We all have an incredible opportunity to change the way people discover entertainment. As our business has grown more complex, we've chosen to retain and hire only the best of the best. This has allowed us to deal with complexity through intelligence instead of through process and layers of management. We stay nimble and trust talented individuals to understand the context of the business. We make good decisions based on that context. We minimize chaos and maximize productivity. It's remarkably energizing to work with 'scary smart' people. It allows us to all reach a little farther because we know that if we stumble there will be people right there with us to keep us from falling. Screwing up doesn't get you fired, as long as you clean it up, learn from it and do it better the next time. Everybody has the freedom to do their jobs how they think it is best done. With that freedom comes responsibility for delivering on those ideas.;It's a lot of work. A lot of difficult, painstaking work. There's enormous pressure to always be getting more done, and doing it faster and better. Fortunately, there's also a lot of really reasonable people that will understand if something doesn't get done because of shifting priorities or unforeseen circumstances. The pressure is there, but it's self-imposed and everyone shares it.;Push more information down, and push it down harder, because there's only so much that can be pulled from the bottom. It's impractical to still have Metrics out by the fountain, but seek and find an equivalent channel that captures that same immediacy and intimacy.

36543;netflix;Hillsboro, OR; Aug 7, 2008;Former  ;Support Staff;Netflix is Great! ...Just Stay Out of the Call Center.;The upper management of Netflix really does seem to want to take a different approach with how they handle their employees, and accepts the fact that as an adult, you're able to get your job done. They appear to be very with it. The call center attempts to echo that sentiment, and provides many perks that make work an alright place to be. From the free coffee and refreshments in the cafeteria to the free rental plan, great benefits, and competitive pay, there is a great ideal that the company attempts to live up to - that the people populating the center are worth the extra buck or two. It was refreshing to work for a company that was capable of identifying problems, and instead of sweeping them under the rug, took the initiative to change the problem.;"Specific to the Hillsboro location, the middle-management is hit-or-miss with whether or not they treat you like a valued member of the team. Many of the team managers do not communicate clearly with their teams - as a member of the support staff, it was evident which managers were taking the time to coach, train, and encourage their teammates, and which were not. Many reps who were extremely good at their job were let go for seemingly innocuous reasons, veiling the manager's personal dislike for the individual. The Hillsboro center has been open since September of 2006, and very few (if any) original cast members from the first three training classes exist. The management of the call center was not in any way stable, the entire team had been replaced once over, and in the less-than two years, they've gone through two site directors. With all of the management, quality, and training staff adjustments, many representatives felt as though getting promoted was a death knell to your time at Netflix. NOT that there were copious opportunities for advancement - quite the contrary. Team managers were hired from outside of the company, and rarely were promotions from within occurring. There were a handful of people who did move up the ladder, and, as previously mentioned, found themselves restructured out of the company, told that there was no longer work for them to do and laid off, or outright fired because they ""dont fit the way the department is going.""";To the senior-most management in Los Gatos, I would ask that you send some sort of internal affairs mole into the call center. Hire someone to see what it's like from the floor's perspective, as naturally the team managers are putting on their best face for you. See what their day-to-day face looks like, and see how it compares. Because you very well might see that some of the individuals in places of authority don't seem to know, in the colloquial, their arse from a hole in the ground.;2;5;;1;4,5;4;9
36544;netflix;Los Gatos, CA; Jul 13, 2008;Current  ;Senior Software Engineer;I wish I would've joined years ago.;Think of the people you've worked with in your career. Now imagine the 5 best of those on one team. That's what working on a team at Netflix is like. Frankly, there are no stupid people here. . Everyone I've met is damn sharp, very sharing of their knowledge and time, and enjoys what they do.  You are treated like an adult. You are not told what to do. Netflix is laissez faire, not command and control. With that comes responsibility and the potential for failure. If you fail often enough, you will not survive. If you dont expose yourself to this risk enough, you won't survive. Some people might consider this a downside, you won't like it at Netflix if you do.  The Netflix time off/vacation policy is that there is no policy. They dont track how many hours you take. You take time off when you want to, you dont have to ask for permission or approval. This non-policy is one example of many of how thoroughly Netflix expects you to behave like an adult. I've spent many years at big name valley companies. Without exception, everyone of them claims that they treat employees like adults. All of them pale in comparison to Netflix in this regard.;"I'm a developer, and the code base at Netflix has warts that demonstrate its laissez faire culture. There is no architecture group with veto power, so the code evolves organically - I personally think this is great, but it can be frustrating. Luckily, it never stays ""ugly"" for long, but it frequently feels like a ball of mud.  There seems to be quite a bit of turnover. The first month I worked here, I counted at least 5 ""good bye"" emails. At least 4 of them were not voluntary. This can be disconcerting. But this is also not a company like Cisco, with regular annual headcount reduction quotas.";Keep doing what you're doing.

And who doesn't want to work ""in the movies""? The pay is pretty decent, the benefits are acceptable.";"It's frustrating to work for direct management who treat you like you're an inconvenience but yet you still provide them with reason to boast about top-rated customer service. Lack of communication. And unless you want to be management, lack of challenge and opportunities for growth. ""Job security"" doesn't really exist for anyone in the Oregon office. Innovation is encouraged yet support for implementing innovation is negligent at best.";Stop being so secretive, just be upfront and honest!

36546;netflix;Los Gatos, CA; Jul 25, 2008;Current  ;Human Resources;Great place to work;The best thing about Netflix is the ability for every single person to have a significant impact on the business. Each employee is given a huge piece of the business to own and we are allowed to make the right call with judgement. There is a ton of flexibility and the lack of policies and procedures makes each person use their brain when making decision. Netflix hires adults and treats them that way.

You're part of a pro team that is highly functioning. The company is well respected and has a super positive brand awareness -- i'm never able to go anywhere without getting peppered with raves and happy customer comments, and i love wearing company logo gear when i'm out for this reason.  You matter at Netflix. There is no dead wood, everyone is doing something very important to the company or they wouldn't be there. What you are doing matters and makes a difference, and that feels good. You can really make a difference no matter what your role.  The company often repeats that as an employee, you're not on an olympic team -- meaning, you dont do this 24/7 with no life, with all focus on the gold. WE're more of a varsity team, playing to win, very good, but still have to balance with classes and learning. We need to have a good work/life balance and its very important to the company that we do.  I think the best thing - and its subtle - is this no vacation/no holiday stuff. you work when you work. they seem to realize that everyone is working hard and all the time. nights. weekends often. a ton of hard work. so if you want to take time off for a vacation, a long holiday, a day off, whatever- it happens at your own discretion. you dont ask, you dont get permission. you just do what you have to do. no one is keeping track. i've never heard of this kind of policy and you cannot imagine what it doest for your morale, for feeling like you're being treated like a grown up. For that rule alone I think it stands beyond any other org.;"Netflix is not for everyone. You dont get ""direction"" so much as everyone shares a common understanding of company strategy and goals. You are free to work, and some will find this harder than just being told what to do. Netflix doesn't have ""average"" workers - everyone is high functioning, highly motivated and independent, and expectations are enormous. There is nothing like a career position here. There is high turn over, and its unnerving to many. There is an understanding: ""good average work and productivity does not get a modest raise, but a generous severence.""  It's a pro team, and the team fit is also as important as the individual performance. You could be excellent, but if you're not HIGHLY communicative, cooperative, egoless, you can get cut just in the team balancing of moving quickly and effectively.  you must be able and willing to share early and often about everything. projects that are new and forming get debated and you have to defend your position and hear critique well. recognizing that criticism is of the work and not you is essential -- a thin skin won't work well. quiet hard work doesn't work well (for some engineers perhaps), you dont ask permission, but you must be able to clearly articulate why you do what you are doing, and support this position. you must realize that ideas are not fragile, and only through debate with smart people who share your understanding of company goals and strategy will ideas be improved.  This is serious work. It's really fun, but make no mistake, it's hard and not for everyone.";I have .

My point is that if you can make good hiring process then you should not be talking about it in an interview. HR is given unreasonable super power and they try to act as super smart for no reason.  They claim to give higher salaries as opposed to other bay area companies but that amount is nothing if you really compare with other companies. I think any company which relies too much on HR for scaring candidates and keeping them in loop regarding performance of candidates is not a good company for engineers and that company is not the most coveted in bay area.  People are hard working but they are certainly not the smartest. Some are smart as in any other company so I dont understand why they create so much of hooplah.;;2;3;;2;2,5;2;9

36605;netflix;; Apr 16, 2011;Former  ;Anonymous Employee;Some good, some bad;The people all tend to be very bright, talented and hard working. There is almost no deadwood.  Historically, everyone made decisions based on the good of the company as a whole instead of what is good for their own teams. The atmosphere was one of mutual respect. Everyone knew everyone. As the company grows it feels like that closeness, respect and shared purpose is getting lost.  Still, it is a good place to work in many ways. The folks at the top are the best I've ever worked for. In the engineering departments, everyone in management all the way up to the CEO is very technical. You can explain anything to any of them without their eyes glazing over.  The fast pace means that you never get bored. There is always some new, interesting challenge.  In the nice to have category, they have free lunches. Many people complain about them, but I always thought they were pretty good. They'll all provided by the same vendor though, so it's easy to get tired of them. The buildings are nice enough. It is easy to get whatever hardware, software, or gadget you think you need. Top-end Mac or Thinkpad with a giant display? An extra desktop or two? Whatever, just put in a ticket and you'll have it in a couple of days or sooner. Need some nice servers for your project? A couple hundred cloud instances? It's all available with minimal fuss.;"When it comes to people, Netflix is a throw away culture. Most people last somewhere around two years before they leave or quit. There seems to be no barriers to stop a manager from firing anyone that works for them. If your manager likes you, everything is peachy but if s/he doesn't like you for any reason at all, you're quickly out the door.  A lot of time gets wasted by new people trying to figure out how a thing works, or (more often) just ripping it out and creating something new since whoever built it is long gone. Then these new people move on to the next company and the cycle starts again.  The ""high performance culture"" in practice means that there are very few useless people. The downside is that you always know that your job is temporary and you're always worried that you'll be fired. It's a stressful way to live.  Netflix prides itself on being a ""nimble"" company. It will occasionally do amazing things in a very short time period. Deadlines can be crazy and they often dont take into account other work that needs to be done. Projects dont replace the workload you already have, they just add to it. Many times you'll deliver on a deadline only to find out that the work was unnecessary as someone decided to completely change the architecture or cancel the project completely.  Everyone is assumed to be available 24x7x365. Email is sent and replied to at all hours of all days and nights. You can never let go of work.  Lastly, the company philosophy is to pay employees and let them decide what to do with the money, so there aren't a ton of perqs for working there. Benefits are okay but not great. No real gym membership, onsite masseuses or anything fancy. The whole company used to go to Sundance every year (payed for by Netflix) but they stopped that some years ago.";There is a price to pay for treating employees as easily replaceable commodities. The lack of process and documentation coupled with high turnover means that once a person has been there long enough to understand the environment, it's time to go.  Netflix goes to a lot of trouble to hire great people. It puts very little effort into keeping them. Employees live with a lot of stress and some fear knowing that they could be fired at any time no matter how hard they work, no matter how long they worked there, and no matter what they accomplished for the company.  Putting a little effort into retaining good employees will make for a happier workforce and more efficiency.;4;3,5;;4;3,5;5;26

When I was terminated, I was one among a group of 12 people who were summoned to a meeting called, ""Business Planning"" that popped up in our calendars a Wednesday morning. We were handed red folders and told we had to give up all of our company equipment immediately and although we were still officially employed until the end of the week, they wanted us to leave immediately and not come back.  I assumed it was my fault, I asked my manager's manager (my manager had left a couple of months before) if there was anything I could have done differently or done better to not have been let go. He said, ""No, you were all right, we just don't need you anymore."" I asked if he could elaborate, but he said he didn't have time to discuss this matter, so I got no exit interview.  I was mostly in shock, because I'd never been fired before and I'd spent nights and weekends at the office, making sure I got my tasks and projects completed on time and correctly, I was confused and slightly bitter.  Thank you glassdoor and all the rest of the former Netflix employees who were also treated so poorly. You've made me realize that it wasn't me. I worked hard and performed well but i was fired for reasons that Netflix didn't want to bother telling me about. I'd never had a disciplinary action or even an employee review during the year that I worked there.  HR can hop onto glassdoor.com and stuff it with praised filled reviews all they want, but we know the truth.  The final kick in the pants was that there was a job posting for my job at Netflix on Monster within a few days.  Final word. Netflix does not care about you at all. They would rather spend more time, money and resources training new employees than reviewing existing employee's performances.";1;1;;1;3;1;12
36624;netflix;; Oct 29, 2009;Former  ;Administrative;I'd still be there if I could;I liked what Netflix calls 'Freedom and Responsibility' - you're free to make decisions - and you are responsible for them. I liked that my boss treated me as an adult, had no problem with me making decisions without his 'stamp', etc. While I didn't love everything about if (no place is perfect) I really enjoyed my time there. It's not for the faint of heart but it's a cool place to be.;While I had a great relationship with my boss and members of my department, there were layers above him (c-level) where politics reigned king and crappy work and behavior was overlooked if it had been done by a 'protected' someone.;Stop moving people around as if they're chess pieces and arbitrarily making life hell for them. You lost some great employees (and I'm not talking about me) in favor of others who don't even support the Netflix ideals you claim to have. On one hand there are some incredibly brilliant minds there (and some wonderful people) but on the other, egos are over-filling the space.;5;5;;3,5;4,5;4,5;0

Going from an environment where the feedback was welcomed and flowed freely to a sweatshop type environment where you show up and pray to make quota. the statistical requirements are getting more and more stringent, focused sharply on the reduction of expenditures. Incredibly high turnover, long term employees are being forced out the door due to these new expectations - and in some cases for expressing distaste in the new direction of our department.  Most employees live in a constant paranoid state hoping not to get fired over a minute percentage change in their scores from week to week. Management is completely disconnected from their employees, most of them have no concept of how their subordinate performs the job which creates an even larger gap between the top and bottom.  During the holidays and a couple of months into the new year (2009) Netflix required mandatory over time for all of the lower level employees in the department, while management took vacation and worked normal shifts. This mandatory overtime averaged between 5 and 8 hours per week for over 3 months straight.  Netflix was unapologetic when demanding that their employees submit to mandatory overtime for months at a time, implying we should be ""Thankful"" for the opportunity. Blatant disregard for their employee's personal time, families, holiday plans and transportation issues compounded complaints about mandatory extra hours, further alienating employees.  There are no names to the faces anymore... just numbers and a bottom line.";2;3;;4;4;1;0

Until the day they let me go with zero explaination. I only can assume it was because I voiced concern of some individuals questionable behavior on offsite meetings.  WIshy washy HR. Supervisors can be let go for anything, but hourly associates once permanent employees are feared and very little is done to be rid of them.

You have lost a lot of talented people in the past few years and lost the respect of many more. This used to be a cool company because it was innovative, creative, nimble, and driven to be successful. Now, it is a company run by a lot of scared people. I don't know of any better way to quash ideas and morale than to conduct business by fear. It is time to really grow up and restore real leadership to the company instead of promoting playground bullies. Term the senior management at the top and install people who have developed current, relevant expertise in the hub ops otherwise you are just running in really weak circles.;1;1;;1;2;1;6

The nature of the job in itself was bad, as the customer service reps are just there to be yelled at for promises that the marketing deptartment was constantly making with little thought as to how these ""features"" would actualy be implimented. The other major issue is the lack of written rules or guidelines. The foundation of their customer service is based on the judgement of each customer service rep. The result is that there was no consistancy regarding the resolution of problems that arose. In other words a customer could get one answer from one rep and a completely different answer the next time they call and talk to a different rep. for the same problem.";There is a reason for the extremely high turnover.

This is a very difficult place to work, especially if you're not tied to the Los Gatos office. The average salaried employee was generally fired within a year or two and rather Darwinian reasons about competitiveness are generally cited as the reason. It seemed like HR had way too much control of the overall operational decisions that were made and much of their decision making seemed to be based on behavior-based psychological principles rather than project performance. This company really needs to add some humanity into how they handle their employees.;Be more up front with potential employees about how long the normal employee stays at Netflix. I saw people being fired so regularly and oftentimes, they had only been there a few months. Open vacation policy also seemed like a crock once you were on the treadmill there.;1;1;;1;3,5;1;11
